Although the use of games in professional education has become widespread only during the last decade, the method has been used in a number of fields for many hundreds of years. Its origins have been traced to simple war games, used in military training when the \"real thing\" was either unavailable or too dangerous.  In more recent times, these games have become more and more sophisticated, and many now use large electronic computers to handle the complex calculations involved. Since 1956, when the first well-developed management game was introduced, the technique has spread rapidly into a wide variety of disciplines and today it is used at all levels of education, from primary school classes to courses for experienced professional men and women.  One of the main causes of this \"game explosion\" has been the rapid development of sophisticated management techniques, such as simulation and mathematical modelling, which have been made possible by rapid advances in computer technology. 4\t2\t5 5\t6\t5 90\t1\t5 91\t1\t5 115\t1\t5 158\t1\t5 207\t1\t5 222\t1\t5 223\t1\t5 234\t1\t5 245\t2\t5 364\t2\t5 365\t1\t5 368\t1\t5 435\t1\t5 535\t1\t5 553\t1\t5 598\t1\t5 615\t1\t5 764\t1\t5 766\t1\t5 811\t2\t5 815\t1\t5 816\t2\t5 818\t1\t5 823\t1\t5 842\t1\t5 915\t1\t5 925\t2\t5 944\t1\t5 948\t1\t5 957\t1\t5 959\t1\t5 960\t1\t5 961\t2\t5 962\t1\t5 964\t1\t5 1023\t2\t5 1219\t1\t5 1227\t1\t5 1257\t1\t5 1365\t1\t5 1390\t1\t5 1400\t1\t5 1400\t1\t5"}

About 48 percent of all academic interlibrary loans are for periodical materials, with the bulk of the loans being satisfied in the form of photocopies.  A major consideration in the long-range improvement of the interlibrary loan system is the possible augmentation with a national system for acquiring, storing, and satisfying loan requests for periodical materials. This study focused on the physical access to the periodical literature.  Based on the needs of the library community, design features were developed, and included the following: Service should be made available to all users without any restriction other than access through a library. Initially, the service should be confined primarily to rapid, dependable delivery of photocopies of journal articles. The collection of a center should be comprehensive in subject coverage excluding only medicine. All worthwhile journals should be collected irrespective of language. 10\t12\t10 145\t1\t10 167\t1\t10 190\t1\t10 225\t1\t10 232\t1\t10 244\t1\t10 304\t1\t10 305\t1\t10 306\t1\t10 358\t1\t10 385\t1\t10 394\t1\t10 400\t1\t10 433\t1\t10 459\t1\t10 534\t1\t10 541\t1\t10 551\t2\t10 702\t1\t10 731\t1\t10 732\t1\t10 788\t1\t10 817\t1\t10 820\t1\t10 823\t1\t10 825\t1\t10 826\t1\t10 827\t1\t10 828\t1\t10 831\t1\t10 881\t1\t10 886\t1\t10 887\t1\t10 919\t1\t10 920\t1\t10 921\t1\t10 942\t1\t10 947\t2\t10 948\t1\t10 1017\t1\t10 1058\t2\t10 1059\t1\t10 1060\t1\t10 1146\t1\t10 1227\t1\t10 1230\t1\t10 1257\t1\t10 1258\t2\t10 1302\t1\t10 1305\t1\t10 1306\t1\t10 1390\t6\t10 1390\t6\t10"}
{"id": 17, "text": "Adventures in Librarianship Voigt, M.J. 1970 There has long been a need for a continuing series to provide scholarly reviews of the rapidly changing and advancing field of librarianship, a series which would select subjects with particular current significance to the profession and provide an analysis of the advances made through research and practice.  Advances in Librarianship is planned and designed to fill this need.  It will present critical articles and surveys based on the published literature, research in progress, and developments in libraries of all types. Mechanization may appear to be the most obvious of the advancing fronts of librarianship, for automation has caught the enthusiastic support of all librarians who can visualize its potential. Advances in this field will certainly be found in every volume of this series. As the first group of articles in this volume demonstrate, technological change has an obvious and direct implication for libraries, but the problem has been found to be much more complex than the simple inventory problem many experts expected. Advances in Librarianship is dedicated to presenting the realities of automation, assessing where we are, where we are going, and how fast we can hope to get there. \"The Machine and Cataloging\" reviews the current status of the machine-produced book catalog and what lies ahead as we enter the age of MARC. Where business methods have greater applicability, progress is easier, as reported in \"Mechanization of Acquisition Processes.\" Even in this area generally acceptable practices and standardization are in the future, not the past. One of the problems of major and immediate importance in computerization of catalog information is that discussed in \"Filing Systems for Computer Manipulation.\" This detailed review presents the complexity of the problems and suggests possible solutions. For many years technical service costs have been defended without adequate knowledge of the facts. As automated procedures are proposed, standards are determining costs of traditional operations become essential. The article on standards for such costs shows why the problems have been difficult and reviews the significant advances of the past few years. The school library has widened its dimensions in materials and services much more rapidly than other libraries, as reflected in its new name, the instructional media center. Here, technical change, together with new teaching methods, has made possible major developments in library service in schools as well as for children in the public library. Two articles make clear that what can be done has been demonstrated, and that what remains is to make this the rule rather than the exception. Bibliotherapy is an example of a field in which progress has been slow. Articles which illustrate the potential which systems theory and managerial planning theory have for libraries. The articles on the application of these concepts, which come from research in administration, are provocative and may appear controversial to some. The article on library development in developing countries provides an analysis in depth of our efforts and degree of success in assisting other countries in providing the library service which is so important in the modern world. 17\t6\t17 17\t6\t17"}

A computer program has been written and used which simulates the several-year operation of an information system and computes estimates of the expected operating costs as well as the amount of equipment and personnel required during that time period.  The program has been used for the analysis of several large systems and has proven itself to be a useful research tool for the study of systems with so many components and interrelated operations that an equivalent manual analysis would be extremely cumbersome and time consuming,and perhaps even impractical. This paper describes this program and shows, as an example, some of the results of a simulation of two of several suggested designs for a specific information system. 27\t5\t27 67\t1\t27 74\t1\t27 83\t1\t27 158\t1\t27 211\t1\t27 324\t1\t27 474\t1\t27 490\t1\t27 491\t1\t27 492\t1\t27 495\t1\t27 496\t1\t27 497\t1\t27 584\t1\t27 591\t1\t27 976\t1\t27 976\t1\t27"}

Inasmuch as scientists in a field disagree about the correctness of inferences, have somewhat different background knowledge, etc., any inference specification can only approximate scientific inference practices.. Two sources of systematic knowledge of document-statement inference practices in a scientific field are described..

An indexing procedure based on that fact is described which would permit retrieval of all answer-providing documents for a question.. However, because the indexing is \"nonrelational\", it could cause false retrievals as well.. Various ways of dealing with such false retrievals are   briefly indicated, and a study is sketched that would provide data for helping selection among them..

For each pattern, journals were ranked by frequency of use and a scatter diagram was drawn.. Patterns I and II largely resembled patterns obtained by counting citations in basic journals or by counting publications of selected researchers.. Pattern III was more widely scattered..  It is concluded that access to diverse journals is needed by researchers to supply new ideas, and that this diversity of reading is not reflected adequately by citation counting or other indirect means.. Current Contents, used by the author for current-awareness purposes in building his card file, generated 88% of all articles.. Scatter diagrams indicated the decreased scatter predicted from its use.. The 30% most important journals in this collection, including about 80% of titles, are ranked for each pattern.."}

{"id": 100, "text": "We can only guess what historians of the future will say about the condition of present-day sociology.  But it seems safe to anticipate one of their observations. When the Trevelyans of 2050 come to write that history - as they well might, for this clan of historians promises to go on forever - they will doubtless find it strange that so few sociologists (and historians) of the twentieth century could bring themselves, in their work, to treat science as one of the great social institutions of the time.  They will observe that long after the sociology of science became an identifiable field of inquiry, it remained little cultivated in a world where science loomed large enough to present mankind with the choice of destruction or survival.  They may even suggest that somewhere in the process by which social scientists take note of the world as it is and as it once was, a sense of values appears to have become badly scrambled."}

Therefore, the new idea is not sufficient to start the take-off into sustained growth in a new field; a new role must be created as well.. In scientific psychology, this occurred in the late nineteenth century in Germany.. Using Germany as a positive case, and France, Britain and the United States as negative cases, it is shown that the new role resulted from academic career opportunities favoring the mobility of practitioners and students of psychology into other fields, and from the relatively low academic standing of speculative philosophy and its consequent receptivity to persons and ideas which promised to turn the study of the human mind into an experimental science.. 33\t1\t101 88\t1\t101 101\t6\t101 102\t2\t101 105\t1\t101 343\t2\t101 391\t1\t101 544\t1\t101 560\t1\t101 605\t1\t101 667\t1\t101 750\t1\t101 775\t1\t101 800\t1\t101 1063\t2\t101 1081\t1\t101 1082\t1\t101 1088\t1\t101 1271\t1\t101 1285\t1\t101 1286\t1\t101 1287\t1\t101 1308\t1\t101 1310\t1\t101 1312\t1\t101 1320\t1\t101 1334\t2\t101 1386\t1\t101 1387\t1\t101 1387\t1\t101"}

This selection in favor of recent literature should be observable in the distribution of footnote citations in a given discipline, by age of article cited.. However, the age distribution of citations also depends on the rate of growth of the disciplinary literature.. The effect of growth of the literature and of selection favoring recent articles can be separated, if certain assumptions hold, by use of an exponential model that expands and clarifies earlier findings by Price.. This model provides a reasonably good fit to age-distributions of footnotes in several disciplines, and its application suggest that citations  in sociology tend to refer to older articles than those in the natural sciences..A parameter in the model, measuring the degree of selectivity in favor of recent articles, can be estimated and may be useful in comparative studies of the communication systems of various disciplines.. 33\t2\t106 39\t1\t106 41\t1\t106 47\t1\t106 48\t3\t106 100\t1\t106 102\t3\t106 104\t2\t106 106\t9\t106 108\t1\t106 110\t1\t106 111\t1\t106 112\t1\t106 113\t3\t106 170\t1\t106 314\t3\t106 377\t1\t106 456\t1\t106 545\t2\t106 560\t1\t106 587\t1\t106 605\t1\t106 632\t2\t106 667\t1\t106 750\t1\t106 764\t1\t106 767\t2\t106 793\t3\t106 794\t1\t106 800\t2\t106 1062\t1\t106 1273\t1\t106 1274\t2\t106 1278\t1\t106 1280\t1\t106 1285\t6\t106 1286\t1\t106 1287\t3\t106 1291\t1\t106 1301\t1\t106 1302\t1\t106 1312\t1\t106 1313\t2\t106 1337\t1\t106 1338\t1\t106 1340\t1\t106 1344\t1\t106 1346\t2\t106 1347\t1\t106 1352\t1\t106 1386\t1\t106 1444\t1\t106 1444\t1\t106"}

Informal communication among biological scientists forms a discernible social structure..

Each of the observed structures is contrasted with a random model.. Neither social status nor the formal social categories show greater association on the social structure than to the random model..

{"id": 113, "text": "The Problem of assessing the \"quality\" of scientific publications has long been a major impediment to progress in the sociology of science.  Most researchers have typically paid homage to the belief that quantity of output is not the equivalent of quality and have then gone ahead and used publication counts anyway (Coler, 1963; Crane, 1965; Price, 1963; Wilson, 1964).  There seemed to be no practicable way to measure the quality of large numbers of papers or the life's work of large numbers of scientists.  The invention of the Science Citation Index (SCI) a few years ago provides a new and reliable tool to measure the significance of individual scientists' contributions.  Starting in 1961, the SCI has listed all bibliographic references appearing in an increasingly large number of journals.  The number of citations an individual receives may be tabulated and used as an indicator of the relative scientific significance or \"quality\" of that individual's publications."}

{"id": 129, "text": "Generation and Uses of Machine-Readable Data Bases Schipma, P.B. This chapter continues the coverage of the generation and use of machine-readable data bases inaugurated in Volume 9 by Williams (178).  It is therefore an update consisting primarily of 1974 material and is prepared in general accordance with Williams's initial compilation. The same definition of data bases and the boundaries of their applications used in Volume 9 are continued this year.  A data base is considered to be an organized collection of machine-readable records containing bibliographic and/or document-related data (e.g., index information). The data bases that we will consider are used for information storage and retrieval and/or research in information storage and retrieval or data base generation. The choice of these constraints precludes coverage of several areas.  First, data bases primarily concerned with numerical or other nonbibliographic information, such as chemical structures, (Milen et al., 112) are excluded. Thus, even though the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Registry Number is a data element common to many bibliographic data bases, papers such as that by CAS regarding progress in building the Registry System itself (39) are excluded.  Similarly, though some textual and bibliographic material is included in the Systems Consultants, Inc report (156) to the Navy, most of the information retrieval is concerned with miniaturized hardware in a shipboard environment and thus is not considered within the scope of this chapter.  Finally, though many of the data bases are used for generation of publications via phototypesetting, we are not considering that production operation. 18\t2\t129 20\t1\t129 42\t1\t129 60\t1\t129 85\t1\t129 121\t1\t129 124\t1\t129 125\t2\t129 127\t4\t129 128\t1\t129 129\t6\t129 130\t1\t129 145\t2\t129 167\t1\t129 172\t1\t129 190\t1\t129 191\t1\t129 197\t1\t129 211\t1\t129 214\t1\t129 218\t1\t129 223\t1\t129 225\t1\t129 234\t1\t129 243\t1\t129 280\t1\t129 307\t1\t129 330\t1\t129 363\t1\t129 376\t1\t129 378\t1\t129 393\t1\t129 432\t1\t129 450\t1\t129 451\t1\t129 452\t1\t129 459\t2\t129 460\t1\t129 461\t1\t129 468\t2\t129 469\t1\t129 484\t1\t129 492\t1\t129 494\t1\t129 508\t1\t129 511\t1\t129 512\t1\t129 514\t1\t129 518\t1\t129 520\t1\t129 523\t1\t129 524\t1\t129 525\t1\t129 526\t1\t129 529\t1\t129 530\t1\t129 534\t1\t129 546\t1\t129 553\t1\t129 579\t1\t129 580\t1\t129 585\t1\t129 594\t1\t129 599\t1\t129 603\t1\t129 604\t1\t129 606\t1\t129 609\t1\t129 610\t1\t129 611\t1\t129 612\t1\t129 622\t1\t129 625\t1\t129 626\t1\t129 630\t1\t129 636\t1\t129 637\t1\t129 639\t1\t129 640\t1\t129 642\t2\t129 643\t1\t129 644\t1\t129 645\t1\t129 646\t2\t129 647\t1\t129 648\t1\t129 649\t1\t129 650\t2\t129 651\t1\t129 652\t1\t129 665\t1\t129 692\t1\t129 696\t1\t129 699\t1\t129 703\t1\t129 705\t1\t129 708\t2\t129 726\t1\t129 727\t1\t129 728\t1\t129 730\t1\t129 731\t1\t129 732\t1\t129 733\t1\t129 734\t1\t129 736\t2\t129 737\t1\t129 738\t2\t129 739\t2\t129 740\t1\t129 741\t2\t129 742\t1\t129 743\t1\t129 744\t1\t129 755\t1\t129 762\t1\t129 765\t1\t129 803\t1\t129 818\t1\t129 820\t1\t129 822\t1\t129 823\t1\t129 826\t1\t129 827\t2\t129 879\t1\t129 883\t1\t129 925\t1\t129 943\t1\t129 944\t1\t129 1004\t1\t129 1022\t1\t129 1035\t1\t129 1045\t1\t129 1070\t1\t129 1078\t1\t129 1085\t1\t129 1089\t1\t129 1091\t1\t129 1143\t2\t129 1207\t1\t129 1264\t1\t129 1268\t1\t129 1297\t1\t129 1303\t1\t129 1356\t1\t129 1364\t1\t129 1368\t1\t129 1370\t1\t129 1372\t1\t129 1373\t1\t129 1374\t3\t129 1375\t1\t129 1376\t2\t129 1377\t1\t129 1390\t1\t129 1396\t1\t129 1401\t1\t129 1437\t1\t129 1437\t1\t129"}

Until the mid-1960's, there were only a few substantial studies of information needs and uses.  Since about 1963, however, a significant literature has grown rapidly. There is evidence now of a productive entente between the fields. When information scientists see reliable, valid, and nontrivial data on users' behavior, they begin to use behavioral criteria in evaluating information system performance.  When behavioral scientists glimpse the full complexity of dissemination, documentation, storage, and retrieval processes, they offer fewer naive solutions to \"the information problem.\" This mutual education and accommodation will undoubtedly continue. Information science and behavioral science need each other.  Big Science needs them both."}

{"id": 160, "text": "Analysis and Organization of Knowledge for Retrieval Farradane, J.E.L. In a university, the mode of research is usually what is called 'pure' or 'basic' research; since I am keeping in mind primarily the applications of information science, I will prefer the word 'basic', although there is not so much difference.  In such research, and really in any good research, one should not be collecting data haphazardly.  One must isolate and define a problem and, as far as possible, control other conditions so that interfering factors are eliminated.  Preferably one will narrow down the problem to manageable proportions.  It is then essential to approach the problem with some sort of hypothesis or theory of the situation, and to concentrate on obtaining evidence for or against that hypothesis.  The important task is to devise just that crucial experiment which will give the answer as efficiently as possible. If the answer disproves the hypothesis, one has at least further evidence upon which to construct a different hypothesis; if it confirms the hypothesis, one is ready for a further step forward, and so on.  Research is easier in a fully controlled and reproducible situation; in a biological or human situation one must often have recourse to statistical methods, but this does not alter the general methodology.  On the whole, I find a clear methodology lacking in much that is being done in the field of information science today. 72\t1\t160 160\t6\t160 168\t1\t160 257\t1\t160 258\t1\t160 477\t1\t160 478\t2\t160 516\t3\t160 558\t2\t160 572\t1\t160 600\t1\t160 628\t1\t160 653\t1\t160 746\t2\t160 758\t1\t160 781\t1\t160 795\t1\t160 817\t1\t160 825\t1\t160 901\t1\t160 1202\t1\t160 1215\t1\t160 1218\t1\t160 1230\t1\t160 1394\t1\t160 1422\t1\t160 1448\t1\t160 1448\t1\t160"}

In the context of the present symposium it would seem appropriate that I should deal specifically with the economic aspects of Selective Dissemination of Information (SDI) operation and use.  In my opinion the technical feasibility and merits of SDI have been adequately demonstrated; the main barriers hindering general use, however, tend to be of an economic nature. At Shell Research in Sittingbourne we have been operating, since 1967, an SDI service for the research staff and it has grown rapidly, particularly since we started to use the CA Condensates tapes early in 1969.  In addition to these tapes we are currently using the BA Previews tapes, AGDOC tapes (prepared by ourselves using punched card input received from Derwent) and, on an experimental basis, Toxitapes, produced by BIOSIS, Philadelphia.

Automation can also be extended to cover some more complicated functions.  In all of these cases, the results supplied by automatic devices are analysed and decisions are taken usually by man.  Thus, the role of machine is to considerably extend man's capabilities rather than to completely replace man. The automated systems intended to accumulate and search for information have come to be called information-retrieval systems (IRS).  These systems can also perform the simpler forms of data processing. The physical facilities of these systems are communications equipment, punched-card computers, microfilming equipment, and electronic computers, the latter playing the most prominent part. 78\t1\t180 179\t1\t180 180\t6\t180 363\t1\t180 572\t1\t180 683\t1\t180 1139\t1\t180 1168\t1\t180 1171\t1\t180 1409\t1\t180 1409\t1\t180"}

The system, called AIM-TWX, was sponsored by the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications and utilized a time-shared IBM 360/67 computer in Santa Monica, California.. Citations from 109 clinically-oriented  journals from 1966 to date, including those currently included in the Abridged Index Medicus, may be retrieved either on- or off-line.. Various aspects of this service are described, including problems of staffing, training, and record keeping, as well as the role of the MeSH vocabulary which is the principle \"language\" of the man-computer dialog.. The statistical results indicated that the system was used for approximately 200 minuted on nineteen days and that an average of sixteen searches were run on any given day, or about 4.6 searches per hour of use.. In spite of an inexperienced staff who had little knowledge of the MeSH vocabulary and whose training schedule was limited to one four-hour session, the experiment was highly successful in terms of searches and citations.. At the end of the period, 298 searches had been run for 114 requestors, and  5,343 citations had been produced.. Only fifty-five searches yielded no citations.. The experiment generated a great deal of excitement and interest among the staff of the Library and of the Medical Center.. Moreover, a large number of medical practitioners in large and small communities  of Virginia participated in this experiment, indicating that there exists a great demand for this type of literature searching which AIM-TWX is able to provide with great rapidity.. 66\t1\t197 120\t1\t197 124\t1\t197 127\t1\t197 129\t1\t197 161\t1\t197 190\t1\t197 191\t1\t197 197\t5\t197 211\t1\t197 214\t1\t197 218\t2\t197 243\t1\t197 307\t1\t197 330\t1\t197 332\t1\t197 375\t1\t197 378\t1\t197 382\t1\t197 445\t1\t197 450\t1\t197 451\t1\t197 452\t1\t197 454\t1\t197 459\t1\t197 468\t1\t197 472\t1\t197 484\t1\t197 492\t1\t197 503\t1\t197 506\t2\t197 507\t1\t197 508\t1\t197 511\t1\t197 512\t1\t197 514\t1\t197 518\t1\t197 520\t1\t197 523\t1\t197 524\t1\t197 525\t1\t197 526\t1\t197 529\t1\t197 530\t1\t197 534\t1\t197 546\t2\t197 553\t1\t197 554\t1\t197 579\t2\t197 591\t1\t197 593\t2\t197 594\t3\t197 595\t1\t197 596\t1\t197 597\t1\t197 599\t1\t197 600\t1\t197 603\t2\t197 604\t2\t197 606\t3\t197 609\t1\t197 610\t1\t197 611\t1\t197 612\t1\t197 625\t1\t197 626\t1\t197 630\t1\t197 634\t1\t197 636\t1\t197 637\t1\t197 642\t1\t197 648\t1\t197 650\t1\t197 692\t1\t197 696\t2\t197 699\t1\t197 703\t1\t197 705\t2\t197 708\t1\t197 723\t1\t197 724\t1\t197 726\t1\t197 727\t1\t197 728\t1\t197 731\t1\t197 732\t1\t197 733\t1\t197 734\t1\t197 736\t2\t197 738\t1\t197 739\t1\t197 740\t1\t197 741\t1\t197 742\t1\t197 743\t1\t197 744\t1\t197 755\t1\t197 795\t1\t197 801\t1\t197 805\t1\t197 806\t1\t197 820\t1\t197 826\t2\t197 827\t1\t197 836\t1\t197 866\t1\t197 867\t1\t197 879\t1\t197 883\t1\t197 956\t1\t197 989\t1\t197 1004\t1\t197 1035\t2\t197 1078\t1\t197 1089\t1\t197 1091\t1\t197 1207\t1\t197 1264\t1\t197 1297\t1\t197 1298\t1\t197 1299\t1\t197 1303\t1\t197 1327\t1\t197 1356\t1\t197 1364\t1\t197 1368\t1\t197 1370\t1\t197 1372\t1\t197 1373\t1\t197 1374\t1\t197 1375\t1\t197 1376\t1\t197 1377\t1\t197 1405\t1\t197 1405\t1\t197"}

MeSH has an effect on the organization of the card catalog; libraries indicate that it is an influential factor in the decision to divide the catalog.. 33\t1\t209 36\t1\t209 90\t1\t209 161\t1\t209 183\t1\t209 184\t1\t209 193\t1\t209 199\t1\t209 201\t1\t209 202\t1\t209 203\t1\t209 204\t1\t209 205\t1\t209 209\t6\t209 212\t1\t209 217\t1\t209 220\t1\t209 222\t1\t209 276\t2\t209 284\t1\t209 286\t1\t209 294\t1\t209 326\t1\t209 543\t1\t209 588\t1\t209 613\t1\t209 624\t1\t209 799\t1\t209 800\t1\t209 808\t1\t209 928\t2\t209 959\t1\t209 963\t1\t209 973\t2\t209 1151\t1\t209 1151\t1\t209"}

This survey led to the formulation of six criterion concepts  (accessibility, cost, user satisfaction, response time, cost/benefit ratio and use).. The advantages and disadvantages of each method of measurement are discussed.. Several points which became clear during the analysis are discussed.. First, there is a relative lack of concern with the rationale behind the evaluation process, although the results invariably lead to a confused interpretation when there is no clear understanding of the purpose of an evaluation.. Second, the total library system is rarely considered; instead, each evaluation criterion is taken in isolation rather than as part of the whole.. Third, the library's preservation function has not been considered at all.."}
{"id": 228, "text": "A Mathematical Theory of Communication Shannon, C.E. The recent development of various methods of modulation such as PCM and PPM which exchange bandwidth for signal-to-noise ratio has intensified the interest in a general theory of communication.  A basis for such a theory is contained in the important papers of Nyquist and Hartley on this subject.  In the present paper we will extend the theory to include a number of new factors, in particular the effect of noise in the channel, and the savings possible due to the statistical structure of the original message and due to the nature of the final destination of the information. The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point.  Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities.  These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem.  The significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages.  The system must be designed to operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design. 19\t2\t228 73\t1\t228 149\t1\t228 175\t1\t228 228\t18\t228 229\t10\t228 318\t1\t228 321\t3\t228 324\t1\t228 329\t3\t228 359\t1\t228 389\t1\t228 390\t1\t228 416\t3\t228 442\t3\t228 450\t2\t228 469\t1\t228 494\t1\t228 495\t2\t228 505\t1\t228 511\t3\t228 521\t1\t228 524\t3\t228 536\t1\t228 540\t1\t228 563\t1\t228 565\t1\t228 567\t1\t228 574\t1\t228 587\t1\t228 599\t1\t228 700\t1\t228 750\t1\t228 751\t1\t228 792\t1\t228 803\t1\t228 804\t1\t228 835\t2\t228 851\t2\t228 862\t2\t228 867\t2\t228 875\t1\t228 1082\t2\t228 1085\t1\t228 1086\t1\t228 1194\t3\t228 1199\t3\t228 1224\t1\t228 1232\t1\t228 1274\t1\t228 1282\t1\t228 1313\t1\t228 1396\t1\t228 1398\t1\t228 1398\t1\t228"}

An examination made over a period of years of the principles of classifying law books for use in libraries, and of their treatment in many general and specialized classification schemes convinced me that no scheme existed which was generally suitable for libraries in English- speaking countries outside the United States.  Law collections in academic libraries in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth were in a particularly difficult position.  They had the choice of adopting one of the good American schemes, which generally make inadequate provision for the needs of overseas Commonwealth libraries; or of adopting one of the English schemes, each of which is virtually tailored to a particular library, and several of which are even less well suited to overseas libraries; or of devising new schemes for themselves.  There seemed to be an urgent need for a practical law classification scheme capable of being used in a variety of libraries, large and small, general and special, academic and professional, in these countries. 29\t1\t261 68\t1\t261 69\t1\t261 90\t1\t261 175\t1\t261 231\t1\t261 261\t5\t261 295\t1\t261 299\t1\t261 334\t1\t261 346\t1\t261 354\t2\t261 382\t1\t261 458\t1\t261 476\t1\t261 477\t1\t261 478\t1\t261 479\t1\t261 480\t1\t261 484\t1\t261 485\t1\t261 566\t1\t261 608\t1\t261 610\t1\t261 617\t1\t261 620\t1\t261 680\t1\t261 704\t1\t261 781\t1\t261 815\t1\t261 938\t1\t261 939\t1\t261 991\t1\t261 992\t1\t261 1118\t1\t261 1175\t1\t261 1221\t1\t261 1318\t1\t261 1365\t1\t261 1390\t1\t261 1390\t1\t261"}

Perhaps the fundamental problem of those that work in the scientific information industry is that it is not just that special part of an information industry that happens to deal with material having a scientific content. Technical librarianship involves much more than librarianship applied to books with an esoteric vocabulary and much mathematics. My reason for choosing this problem as a contribution for such a strategic conference is that I know well as an historian of science that the greatest and most useful advances in our technologies have not come from the applied research of trained people trying to make themselves useful to society, but rather from basic research aimed at furthering understanding and curiousity, and powered by the latest instrumentation that the useful people have devised. I suspect that all the new indexing tools and computer handlings will be more useful to basic research in understanding scientists than they will to solving practical problems for which they are designed.  It seems clear, however, that it is only such new understanding that can bring success, whatever solutions ultimately emerge. 33\t1\t314 48\t1\t314 89\t1\t314 100\t1\t314 102\t2\t314 105\t1\t314 106\t3\t314 108\t1\t314 110\t1\t314 113\t2\t314 155\t1\t314 157\t1\t314 314\t7\t314 356\t1\t314 359\t1\t314 544\t1\t314 545\t1\t314 560\t1\t314 573\t1\t314 582\t1\t314 587\t1\t314 605\t1\t314 656\t1\t314 685\t1\t314 748\t1\t314 750\t1\t314 767\t2\t314 775\t1\t314 778\t1\t314 787\t1\t314 791\t1\t314 793\t1\t314 794\t1\t314 800\t2\t314 808\t1\t314 1030\t1\t314 1050\t1\t314 1062\t1\t314 1256\t1\t314 1273\t1\t314 1274\t1\t314 1284\t1\t314 1285\t4\t314 1290\t1\t314 1291\t1\t314 1293\t1\t314 1294\t1\t314 1295\t1\t314 1296\t1\t314 1297\t1\t314 1312\t1\t314 1313\t1\t314 1319\t1\t314 1337\t1\t314 1338\t1\t314 1346\t1\t314 1352\t1\t314 1386\t2\t314 1386\t2\t314"}

Using direct access computer files of bibliographic information, an attempt is made to overcome one of the problems often associated with information retrieval, namely, the maintenance and use of large dictionaries, the greater part of which is used only infrequently. A novel method is presented, which maps they hyperbolic frequency distribution of text characteristics onto a rectangular distribution.  This is more suited to implementation on storage devices. This method treats text as a string of characters rather than words bounded by spaces, and chooses subsets of strings such that their frequencies of occurrence are more even than those of word types.  The members of this subset are then used as index keys for retrieval.  The rectangular distribution of key frequencies results in a much simplified file organization and promises considerable cost advantages. text searching, information theory, filed organization, direct access, information retrieval, character string, bit vector 3.42 3.70 3.73 3.74 5.6 19\t2\t321 228\t3\t321 229\t1\t321 318\t1\t321 321\t6\t321 324\t1\t321 329\t2\t321 416\t2\t321 419\t1\t321 442\t2\t321 450\t2\t321 459\t1\t321 495\t1\t321 511\t2\t321 521\t1\t321 524\t2\t321 562\t1\t321 563\t1\t321 565\t1\t321 567\t1\t321 643\t1\t321 660\t1\t321 700\t1\t321 835\t2\t321 851\t2\t321 862\t2\t321 867\t1\t321 875\t1\t321 1194\t2\t321 1199\t3\t321 1218\t1\t321 1327\t1\t321 1427\t1\t321 1427\t1\t321"}

This study is an attempt to submit to a critical analysis the main problems related to corporate headings, the difficulties raised by them and the solutions which now prevail in various countries. In order to make the differences existing between the various solutions and the unsatisfactory character revealed by many of them more evident, a great number of examples in a variety of languages, extracted from cataloguing codes, national bibliographies, printed lists of corporate headings have been added.  These examples are also intended to draw attention to differences existing with regard to various technical details, such as punctuation, capitalization, transliteration, etc. In addition, many of these examples will clearly prove that certain solutions which may be considered to be suitable for one country or one language would not satisfy the requirements of another country or another language. In the study, examination and analysis of codes has been complemented by references to professional literature on the subject available to the author, and by an analysis of opinions expressed there.  Special attention has been paid to comparisons of cataloguing practices and citation usages, and to investigations of the users' approach to corporate headings.  It is well understood and appreciated that, for the catalogue user, the identification of and search for corporate headings present more problems than any other type of heading.

This volume synthesizes these findings and theories. 15\t1\t356 89\t2\t356 102\t1\t356 105\t3\t356 110\t1\t356 111\t1\t356 113\t2\t356 139\t1\t356 147\t1\t356 155\t1\t356 157\t1\t356 161\t1\t356 163\t1\t356 243\t1\t356 312\t3\t356 314\t1\t356 356\t11\t356 391\t1\t356 426\t1\t356 436\t3\t356 437\t2\t356 475\t1\t356 544\t2\t356 545\t1\t356 560\t3\t356 582\t1\t356 592\t1\t356 602\t1\t356 607\t1\t356 656\t1\t356 658\t1\t356 685\t1\t356 1030\t2\t356 1036\t1\t356 1041\t1\t356 1050\t3\t356 1062\t1\t356 1154\t1\t356 1186\t1\t356 1187\t2\t356 1256\t1\t356 1284\t1\t356 1285\t1\t356 1288\t1\t356 1290\t1\t356 1291\t2\t356 1293\t2\t356 1294\t1\t356 1295\t1\t356 1296\t2\t356 1297\t1\t356 1298\t1\t356 1300\t1\t356 1319\t1\t356 1321\t1\t356 1333\t2\t356 1346\t3\t356 1347\t1\t356 1386\t2\t356 1406\t1\t356 1407\t1\t356 1407\t1\t356"}
{"id": 359, "text": "Documentation Bradford, S.C. 1948 More than half a century ago La Fontaine and Otlet started their lives' work, which at first was connected with the term \"bibliography,\" but to which gradually the work \"Documentation\" was attributed.  What they developed was of a far wider scope than the establishment of a new technique dealing with printed and non-printed documents. The great deal which inspired them, and those who worked side by side with them, was to render accessible the totality of what is crystallized from human thought and to make of it a common treasure of mankind, serving to bring mutual comprehension and to build for peace by the co-operation of all men of goodwill of all nations. It was in this spirit that my friend Bradford joined those men, whose noble faces have passed and to whom it never was given to see the achievement of the work to which they devoted their lives. And it was in this spirit that Bradford, thanks to his knowledge and experience as scientist as well as librarian, not only gave his strong and valuable support to the common work but added to it fundamental and constructive new elements. Just for this reason the present book we owe to him gives far more than a mere compilation of facts and experiences.  Such a compilation would indeed be welcome because, curiously enough, up to now, there is no good general treatise on documentation available.  But his book gives us before all things an abundance of original ideas and creative thoughts. 19\t1\t359 31\t1\t359 36\t1\t359 37\t1\t359 39\t1\t359 40\t1\t359 41\t1\t359 44\t2\t359 47\t1\t359 55\t1\t359 57\t2\t359 62\t3\t359 76\t1\t359 81\t1\t359 88\t1\t359 89\t1\t359 97\t1\t359 98\t1\t359 100\t1\t359 102\t1\t359 103\t1\t359 107\t1\t359 111\t1\t359 131\t2\t359 133\t1\t359 136\t1\t359 138\t1\t359 140\t1\t359 149\t1\t359 162\t1\t359 167\t1\t359 175\t1\t359 184\t1\t359 189\t1\t359 193\t1\t359 195\t1\t359 196\t1\t359 201\t2\t359 203\t1\t359 204\t1\t359 205\t1\t359 210\t1\t359 215\t1\t359 219\t1\t359 221\t2\t359 228\t1\t359 229\t1\t359 233\t2\t359 253\t1\t359 255\t1\t359 267\t1\t359 313\t1\t359 314\t1\t359 329\t1\t359 359\t33\t359 373\t1\t359 377\t1\t359 378\t1\t359 379\t2\t359 382\t1\t359 395\t2\t359 415\t1\t359 416\t3\t359 475\t1\t359 487\t1\t359 494\t1\t359 505\t3\t359 511\t1\t359 515\t1\t359 560\t1\t359 573\t4\t359 587\t2\t359 602\t1\t359 616\t1\t359 618\t2\t359 625\t1\t359 632\t1\t359 634\t1\t359 635\t2\t359 667\t2\t359 700\t1\t359 744\t1\t359 748\t10\t359 749\t1\t359 750\t2\t359 751\t7\t359 756\t1\t359 759\t5\t359 764\t1\t359 765\t9\t359 767\t3\t359 775\t1\t359 776\t1\t359 777\t1\t359 778\t12\t359 782\t1\t359 787\t5\t359 788\t1\t359 791\t6\t359 792\t2\t359 793\t1\t359 800\t2\t359 804\t3\t359 805\t1\t359 872\t1\t359 893\t5\t359 905\t1\t359 915\t1\t359 925\t1\t359 952\t2\t359 961\t1\t359 1016\t5\t359 1019\t1\t359 1030\t1\t359 1055\t1\t359 1061\t1\t359 1062\t1\t359 1071\t2\t359 1076\t1\t359 1081\t2\t359 1082\t2\t359 1083\t8\t359 1084\t1\t359 1085\t13\t359 1086\t8\t359 1087\t2\t359 1090\t3\t359 1097\t1\t359 1098\t1\t359 1114\t1\t359 1122\t1\t359 1147\t1\t359 1157\t1\t359 1173\t3\t359 1182\t5\t359 1196\t1\t359 1200\t1\t359 1201\t3\t359 1203\t1\t359 1226\t1\t359 1274\t1\t359 1275\t1\t359 1277\t1\t359 1278\t2\t359 1280\t1\t359 1282\t1\t359 1285\t1\t359 1287\t1\t359 1291\t1\t359 1296\t1\t359 1301\t2\t359 1302\t7\t359 1304\t1\t359 1313\t1\t359 1317\t1\t359 1338\t1\t359 1344\t1\t359 1347\t1\t359 1352\t1\t359 1380\t1\t359 1401\t1\t359 1417\t1\t359 1418\t1\t359 1428\t1\t359 1444\t1\t359 1444\t1\t359"}

{"id": 373, "text": "Librarians, publishers, and information system engineers have very little verified information and few guidelines to describe the user's specific requirements for information.  Such information is needed to properly design or evaluate the information systems.  To date, most of the statements of requirements have been rather subjective, and often reflect opinion rather than actual fact.  Relatively little objective data have been obtained.  This is probably due in large part to the fact that there are extremely difficult methodological problems in trying to determine and state user requirements in a meaningful manner.  This paper suggests an approach or point of view that might help this situation by providing a method of phrasing the statements of user requirements in a more convenient and meaningful manner.  This paper also furnishes several examples of such statements, and discusses the techniques and data that support these statements. In this paper, attention is initially focused on the information requirements of workers in the field of science and technology, with no serious attempt made to include workers in other fields.  However, it seems quite likely that the approach, and perhaps even the stated principles, could be extended and generalized to cover other fields of knowledge."}
{"id": 380, "text": "Error-correcting Codes Peterson, W.W. Several major developments have contributed to the rapid emergence of the field of error-correcting codes over the past two decades. Externally, the cost of solid-state electronic devices has decreased almost as dramatically as their size.  This has stimulated the development of digital computers and peripheral devices and this, in turn, has caused a dramatic increase in the volume of data communicated between such machines.  The intolerance of computing systems to error, and in some cases the inherently critical nature of the data demand the use of either error-free facilities or some type of error-detecting or correcting code in the terminal devices.  In many cases the latter approach is the more economical. 380\t5\t380 380\t5\t380"}

What are the needs being served by informal communication? What can be done about giving informal communication, without destroying its function for the active researcher, certain of the advantages of formal communication, such as, general accessibility, permanence, etc.?  How can formal channels be manipulated to take on the characteristics of informal communication?  To cast light on these questions the present paper examines the role of informal and formal channels within the overall system of scientific dissemination in psychology, considers the special advantages of informal communication, and outlines certain relations between informal and formal channels.  In a final section of the paper, two experiments in scientific communication are described; one experiment being built about an innovation that attempts to \"informalize\" formal channels while the other is built about another innovation that, in general, attempts to \"formalize\" an informal channel.  24\t1\t398 62\t1\t398 65\t1\t398 66\t1\t398 75\t1\t398 76\t1\t398 95\t1\t398 98\t1\t398 105\t1\t398 109\t1\t398 137\t1\t398 162\t1\t398 163\t1\t398 210\t1\t398 278\t1\t398 279\t1\t398 280\t1\t398 386\t4\t398 395\t1\t398 398\t5\t398 544\t1\t398 560\t1\t398 658\t1\t398 716\t1\t398 748\t1\t398 782\t1\t398 788\t1\t398 789\t1\t398 837\t1\t398 925\t1\t398 933\t1\t398 1063\t1\t398 1076\t1\t398 1083\t1\t398 1142\t1\t398 1270\t1\t398 1284\t2\t398 1300\t1\t398 1361\t1\t398 1400\t1\t398 1404\t1\t398 1408\t1\t398 1446\t1\t398 1447\t1\t398 1447\t1\t398"}

{"id": 440, "text": "This article is the last in series which describes a set of studies which were conducted over a 4,5-year period (1966-1971).. The series of articles sought to describe a comprehensive picture of the dissemination and assimilation of scientific information as it flows through various informal and formal media, from the time a scientist initiates his work until it is published.. The present article examines the continuity of scientific work and information exchange by \"productive scientists\" two years after the publication of their articles in 1968/1969.. The results indicate that about half of the authors had changed to a subject-matter area which differed from that of their earlier articles, however, such shifts did not decrease authors' productivity nor greatly increase their information needs.."}
{"id": 448, "text": "An Evaluation of Query Expansion by the Addition of Clustered Terms for a Document Retrieval System Minker, Jack Wilson, Gerald A. Zimmerman, Barbara H. An evaluation of graph theoretical clusters of index terms which can be extracted from an automatically indexed document collection, and the effects of employing such cluster in automatic document retrieval is described.. The graph theoretical cluster which were developed from six data base under two different cluster definition were analyzed for average size and related data.. The clusters were also used to expand the queries in each of six data bases to determine the effect of the expansions on the document retrieval results.. Although a large variety of clusters and associated query explanations were obtained, no significant improvements in the document retrieval performance were achieved.. In some cases, however, significant degradations in the retrieval performance occurred.. Although seemingly meaningful clusters can be obtained, the results indicate that the effort involved in finding clusters and adding the clustered terms to queries is far to great to warrant their use in an operational system.. The data bases employed were relatively small, and the  authors caution against generalizing these results to large data bases or other  situations.. 51\t1\t448 69\t1\t448 71\t2\t448 77\t2\t448 79\t2\t448 124\t1\t448 125\t1\t448 165\t1\t448 168\t1\t448 175\t2\t448 176\t2\t448 315\t1\t448 381\t1\t448 382\t1\t448 448\t6\t448 452\t1\t448 462\t1\t448 480\t1\t448 483\t1\t448 484\t2\t448 486\t1\t448 488\t2\t448 491\t1\t448 493\t1\t448 503\t1\t448 507\t1\t448 509\t2\t448 510\t1\t448 511\t1\t448 512\t1\t448 516\t1\t448 517\t1\t448 518\t1\t448 520\t1\t448 521\t1\t448 522\t2\t448 523\t1\t448 526\t1\t448 527\t2\t448 528\t2\t448 529\t1\t448 531\t1\t448 565\t3\t448 566\t1\t448 575\t1\t448 581\t1\t448 596\t1\t448 603\t1\t448 608\t1\t448 610\t1\t448 615\t1\t448 625\t1\t448 626\t1\t448 633\t1\t448 636\t1\t448 659\t3\t448 660\t1\t448 700\t1\t448 705\t1\t448 707\t1\t448 715\t1\t448 727\t1\t448 754\t2\t448 790\t1\t448 805\t1\t448 809\t1\t448 810\t2\t448 812\t2\t448 813\t1\t448 814\t1\t448 817\t2\t448 824\t2\t448 825\t1\t448 875\t1\t448 894\t2\t448 1051\t1\t448 1202\t1\t448 1294\t2\t448 1303\t1\t448 1327\t2\t448 1364\t1\t448 1366\t1\t448 1367\t1\t448 1368\t1\t448 1419\t1\t448 1427\t1\t448 1427\t1\t448"}

This book deals with the simplest of the three corrective measures - the improvement of the document retrieval system.  There are different ways and means of accomplishing this, and these methods of improving the organization and retrieval of personal document collections are the principal topics to be covered.  The book is addressed primarily to the researcher in any subject field who desires to improve the index to his document collection or start an index to his document collection but does not quite know how to go about it.  An index is herein defined as a systematic organization of a collection of documents or data.  There are indexes to various types of document and data collections, and there are various types of indexes.  Examples of familiar indexes are indexes to individual books, to collections of books (the card catalog in a library), to the contents of journals or periodicals (for example, the Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature), to collections of facts (for example, a telephone directory), or to numeric data (such as physical constants of a group of compounds or numeric data collected in a questionnaire study). 161\t1\t472 197\t1\t472 375\t1\t472 445\t1\t472 454\t1\t472 472\t6\t472 503\t1\t472 506\t1\t472 507\t1\t472 554\t1\t472 579\t1\t472 591\t1\t472 593\t1\t472 594\t1\t472 595\t1\t472 596\t1\t472 597\t1\t472 599\t1\t472 600\t1\t472 603\t1\t472 604\t1\t472 606\t1\t472 723\t1\t472 724\t1\t472 801\t1\t472 805\t1\t472 806\t1\t472 836\t1\t472 866\t1\t472 867\t1\t472 956\t1\t472 989\t1\t472 1298\t1\t472 1299\t1\t472 1327\t1\t472 1405\t1\t472 1405\t1\t472"}
{"id": 475, "text": "Factors Affecting the Preferences of Industrial Personnel for Information Gathering Methods Rosenberg, Victor A structured questionnaire was administered to professional personnel in industrial and government organizations, asking the subjects to rank eight information gathering methods according to their preference in given hypothetical situation.. The subjects were then asked to rate the methods on a seven point scale according to (a) ease of use and (b) amount of information expected.. The subjects were divided into two groups determined by their time spent in research or research related activities.. The groups were designated \"research\" and \"nonresearch\".. A statistical analysis of the data from 96 subjects (52 in research, 44 in nonresearch) showed that no statistically significant differences were present in either the rankings or ratings between research and nonresearch personnel..

{"id": 478, "text": "Concept Organization for Information Retrieval Farradane, J. All analysis of information for storage and of questions for effecting retrieval must be in terms of concepts and the relations between them. The concepts may be just words (descriptors), as in simple post-co-ordinate keyword indexing systems, or they may be class-terms or other idea-groupings, as in classifications.  The relations between concepts often appear to be absent, but if more than one word is used in indexing or in a search there is clearly an implicit relation between them in the mind of the indexer or questioner, and other relations possible between the words would lead to false drops.  Classification has traditionally been a method of organization of concepts in which the relations between concepts are ostensibly displayed in the form of groupings called classes. 29\t1\t478 68\t1\t478 69\t1\t478 160\t2\t478 175\t1\t478 257\t1\t478 261\t1\t478 346\t1\t478 382\t1\t478 458\t1\t478 476\t1\t478 477\t1\t478 478\t9\t478 479\t1\t478 480\t4\t478 484\t1\t478 485\t1\t478 516\t3\t478 566\t1\t478 680\t1\t478 704\t1\t478 746\t1\t478 758\t2\t478 781\t1\t478 785\t1\t478 825\t1\t478 1118\t1\t478 1175\t1\t478 1215\t3\t478 1448\t1\t478 1448\t1\t478"}

{"id": 497, "text": "Some Cost Estimates for Bibliographical Searching in a Large-Scale Social Sciences Information System Thompson, G.K. Many of the large-scale mechanized information systems in operation today grew up because of the need of the military and para-military establishments to have rapid access to large quantities of scientific and technological information.  This paper will deal with two complementary efforts in the field of social sciences, where an awareness of the information problem is acute, and the global needs staggering.  The target audiences for these two systems are on the one hand social science researchers and on the other policy planners and makers in the broad field of economic and social development. An operational system (in the International Labour Office) will be described, and an array of figures representing actual or theoretical operating costs will be given.  As could be expected, however, these figures relate only to costs of systems development, input preparation, file maintenance and retrieval.  No attempt can be made to evaluate in other than general terms the economic impact that the existence of such a system may have.  It can be readily demonstrated, however, that computer-assisted information systems may make sense within individual institutional environments, and make greater sense when on-line systems linking various collaborating institutions can result in enabling each to operate more efficiently and at lower cost.  The existence of such on-line networks would make the greatest sense for users because of the possibility of having access at a reasonable price to large information stores. 27\t1\t497 38\t1\t497 74\t1\t497 83\t1\t497 84\t1\t497 158\t1\t497 172\t1\t497 218\t1\t497 243\t1\t497 253\t1\t497 375\t1\t497 408\t1\t497 482\t1\t497 488\t1\t497 489\t1\t497 490\t3\t497 491\t3\t497 492\t4\t497 493\t1\t497 494\t1\t497 495\t2\t497 496\t3\t497 497\t5\t497 498\t1\t497 499\t1\t497 500\t1\t497 506\t1\t497 507\t1\t497 508\t1\t497 510\t1\t497 548\t1\t497 581\t2\t497 583\t1\t497 584\t2\t497 586\t1\t497 591\t1\t497 594\t1\t497 601\t1\t497 604\t1\t497 607\t1\t497 659\t1\t497 795\t1\t497 801\t1\t497 866\t1\t497 867\t1\t497 986\t1\t497 1035\t1\t497 1042\t1\t497 1087\t1\t497 1207\t1\t497 1294\t2\t497 1327\t1\t497 1327\t1\t497"}

We present completely automatic procedures for the self-generation of meaningful groups among the members of a document collection and for the classification according to these groups of subsequent documents.. These procedures operate on large document collections with reasonably short computation times.. Thus far, in our experiments on the physics literature, automatic classification has proven to be as good as or better than manual indexing and, in addition, potentially less expensive.. Empirically derived, our method is based upon a pattern discovery algorithm which use only the citation content of a document and with operates on the bibliographic links among papers.. The self-generated groups correspond to very specific subject headings; retrospective bibliographies generated in the procedures allow one to classify the subsequent literature with remarkably high recall and relevance ratios, close to 100%.. 39\t6\t503 47\t1\t503 48\t1\t503 50\t1\t503 51\t1\t503 69\t1\t503 71\t1\t503 77\t1\t503 79\t1\t503 102\t1\t503 113\t1\t503 114\t1\t503 161\t1\t503 168\t1\t503 175\t5\t503 176\t1\t503 197\t1\t503 315\t1\t503 326\t1\t503 375\t1\t503 382\t1\t503 420\t1\t503 445\t1\t503 446\t1\t503 448\t1\t503 454\t1\t503 458\t1\t503 472\t1\t503 473\t1\t503 480\t1\t503 483\t1\t503 484\t1\t503 485\t3\t503 486\t1\t503 488\t1\t503 491\t1\t503 493\t1\t503 503\t12\t503 506\t1\t503 507\t2\t503 509\t1\t503 510\t1\t503 512\t1\t503 513\t1\t503 517\t2\t503 520\t1\t503 522\t1\t503 527\t1\t503 528\t1\t503 531\t1\t503 554\t1\t503 565\t1\t503 566\t1\t503 572\t1\t503 576\t3\t503 579\t1\t503 581\t1\t503 589\t2\t503 591\t1\t503 593\t1\t503 594\t1\t503 595\t1\t503 596\t2\t503 597\t1\t503 599\t1\t503 600\t1\t503 603\t2\t503 604\t1\t503 606\t1\t503 608\t1\t503 616\t1\t503 632\t1\t503 633\t1\t503 657\t2\t503 659\t1\t503 662\t1\t503 666\t1\t503 715\t1\t503 723\t1\t503 724\t1\t503 754\t1\t503 773\t1\t503 790\t1\t503 801\t1\t503 805\t3\t503 806\t1\t503 809\t1\t503 810\t1\t503 812\t1\t503 813\t1\t503 814\t1\t503 817\t1\t503 824\t1\t503 825\t1\t503 836\t1\t503 866\t1\t503 867\t1\t503 894\t1\t503 956\t1\t503 958\t1\t503 989\t1\t503 1051\t1\t503 1144\t1\t503 1207\t1\t503 1210\t1\t503 1274\t1\t503 1277\t1\t503 1283\t1\t503 1285\t1\t503 1294\t1\t503 1298\t1\t503 1299\t1\t503 1300\t1\t503 1308\t1\t503 1313\t2\t503 1327\t3\t503 1386\t1\t503 1405\t2\t503 1419\t1\t503 1426\t1\t503 1427\t1\t503 1427\t1\t503"}

Condensations in the form of logical jumps, or the omission of a concept with one relation out of a string of three concepts with two interstitial relations, have been investigated by two different methods, in order to overcome one of these technicalities.. Thirty-two rules are proposed which could permit the automatic condensation of either of both the stored information and the question, when the concepts and relations are in the form of linear or string display..

In the second broad category of theories, problems are stated and analysis carried out in terms of more rigorous-appearing concepts and units of analysis.

{"id": 562, "text": "The Association Factor in Information Retrieval Stiles, H. Edmund This paper describes an all computer document retrieval system which can find documents related to a request even though they may not be indexed by the exact terms of the request, and can present these documents in the order of their relevance to the request.. The key to this ability lies in the application of a statistical formula by which the computer calculates the degree of association between pairs of index terms.. With proper manipulation of these associations (entirely within the machine) a vocabulary of synonyms, near synonyms and other words closely related to any given term or group of terms is derived.. Such a vocabulary related to a group of request terms is believed to be a much more powerful tool for selecting documents from a collection than has been available heretofore.. By noting the number of matching terms between this extended list of request terms and the terms used to index a document, and with due regard for their degree of association, documents are selected by the computer and arranged in the order of their relevance to the request.. 26\t3\t562 45\t1\t562 78\t1\t562 174\t1\t562 175\t2\t562 179\t1\t562 315\t1\t562 321\t1\t562 363\t1\t562 419\t3\t562 420\t1\t562 421\t1\t562 422\t1\t562 458\t1\t562 479\t1\t562 485\t1\t562 562\t7\t562 564\t3\t562 566\t2\t562 570\t1\t562 659\t1\t562 660\t3\t562 661\t1\t562 662\t2\t562 663\t2\t562 664\t3\t562 769\t1\t562 785\t1\t562 1044\t1\t562 1087\t1\t562 1144\t1\t562 1154\t1\t562 1218\t2\t562 1279\t1\t562 1327\t1\t562 1327\t1\t562"}

The first stage describes an experiment that explores properties of the class of words that are not useful in conveying subject meaning and distinguishes them from those classes of words that do convey subject meaning to various degrees.  In particular, we study the clustering properties of these words; the analysis is based on statistical properties alone, and techniques are introduced that may be of value in other areas of information science.  On the basis of the results of this experiment, a model of word occurrences is introduced and discussed.  Later papers by us and by Harter will apply this model to indexing."}
{"id": 587, "text": "Obsolescence of Special Library Periodicals: Sampling Errors and Utility Contours Brookes, B. C. Problems arising in the measurement of the rates of obsolescence of the sets of periodicals taken by special libraries are discussed.. The relatively large errors that arise in sampling the negative exponential distribution are analyzed because they may account for some of the discrepancies reported and because they indicate the need for firmer statistical control of work on obsolescence than has yet been generally appreciated.. When the rate of decline has been satisfactorily established there still remains the problem of deciding how to apply it.. Issues of those periodicals that contribute most productively should be retained for a longer period than those of periodicals that contribute less.. To solve this problem the concept of \"utility contours\" is introduced and exemplified in the design of a p% library.. It is argued that no discarding policy is likely to be generally applicable; every special library must be regarded as a special case.  Rather than suggest new measurements, therefore, the paper offers simple graphical techniques that are applicable to any other special case.. 33\t2\t587 36\t2\t587 41\t1\t587 57\t1\t587 73\t1\t587 89\t1\t587 97\t1\t587 102\t1\t587 106\t1\t587 111\t1\t587 112\t1\t587 149\t1\t587 155\t1\t587 163\t1\t587 175\t1\t587 183\t1\t587 184\t2\t587 193\t2\t587 195\t1\t587 199\t1\t587 201\t1\t587 203\t2\t587 204\t1\t587 205\t1\t587 210\t1\t587 222\t1\t587 225\t2\t587 228\t1\t587 229\t1\t587 233\t1\t587 267\t2\t587 269\t1\t587 314\t1\t587 359\t2\t587 373\t1\t587 395\t1\t587 494\t2\t587 515\t1\t587 519\t1\t587 545\t1\t587 552\t1\t587 587\t15\t587 605\t1\t587 613\t1\t587 614\t1\t587 638\t1\t587 667\t1\t587 713\t1\t587 735\t1\t587 747\t1\t587 748\t1\t587 750\t5\t587 751\t2\t587 753\t1\t587 759\t1\t587 764\t2\t587 765\t1\t587 766\t1\t587 767\t3\t587 775\t3\t587 778\t2\t587 780\t1\t587 782\t1\t587 784\t1\t587 787\t1\t587 788\t1\t587 789\t1\t587 791\t1\t587 792\t4\t587 793\t7\t587 794\t5\t587 800\t7\t587 804\t1\t587 808\t3\t587 823\t1\t587 824\t1\t587 829\t1\t587 840\t1\t587 895\t1\t587 905\t1\t587 925\t1\t587 948\t1\t587 953\t1\t587 977\t1\t587 983\t1\t587 1016\t1\t587 1023\t1\t587 1030\t1\t587 1055\t1\t587 1081\t1\t587 1082\t1\t587 1083\t1\t587 1085\t2\t587 1086\t2\t587 1087\t1\t587 1090\t1\t587 1091\t1\t587 1123\t1\t587 1135\t1\t587 1201\t1\t587 1219\t1\t587 1222\t1\t587 1260\t1\t587 1275\t1\t587 1276\t1\t587 1278\t2\t587 1280\t1\t587 1282\t1\t587 1285\t4\t587 1286\t1\t587 1287\t2\t587 1302\t1\t587 1307\t1\t587 1308\t1\t587 1324\t1\t587 1335\t1\t587 1390\t1\t587 1397\t1\t587 1401\t1\t587 1416\t1\t587 1417\t3\t587 1418\t1\t587 1428\t1\t587 1432\t1\t587 1432\t1\t587"}
{"id": 588, "text": "Cardiovascular Serial Literature: Characteristics, Productive Journals, and Abstracting/Indexing Coverage Frick, Barbara F. Ginski, John M. Two groups of journals were identified as potential sources for cardiovascular (c-v) information.. The first group consists of 78 c-v specialty journals, identified as cardiovascular from the title.. These 78 emanate from 24 countries, with about one-half of the specialty journals being published by 28 national and international societies.. The second group of journals is composed of those journals used by grantees of the National Heart Institute (NHI) to publish their findings.. In fiscal 1967, 5,860 papers, appearing in 789 journals, were reported to NHI.. Taking the grantees of NHI as being representative of U.S. c-v researchers, it was found that the specialty journals were not the most quantitatively fertile sources of c-v information - only about 14% of American c-v papers were published there.. The remaining 86% of the literature was widely dispersed throughout 766 nonspecialty c-v journals.. The extent of bibliographic control by the major indexing and abstracting services was found to be more extensive for the top-ranking journals in the NHI sample than for the group of c-v specialty journals.. 33\t1\t588 36\t1\t588 90\t1\t588 91\t1\t588 161\t1\t588 183\t1\t588 184\t1\t588 193\t1\t588 198\t1\t588 199\t1\t588 201\t1\t588 202\t1\t588 203\t1\t588 204\t1\t588 205\t1\t588 209\t1\t588 212\t1\t588 217\t1\t588 220\t1\t588 222\t1\t588 284\t1\t588 286\t1\t588 294\t1\t588 379\t1\t588 429\t1\t588 513\t1\t588 543\t1\t588 582\t1\t588 588\t6\t588 589\t1\t588 603\t1\t588 613\t3\t588 614\t1\t588 616\t1\t588 618\t1\t588 624\t1\t588 657\t1\t588 685\t2\t588 686\t1\t588 691\t1\t588 721\t1\t588 722\t1\t588 724\t1\t588 725\t1\t588 735\t1\t588 775\t1\t588 793\t1\t588 799\t1\t588 800\t1\t588 808\t1\t588 821\t1\t588 958\t1\t588 959\t1\t588 987\t1\t588 988\t1\t588 1010\t1\t588 1086\t1\t588 1087\t1\t588 1151\t1\t588 1208\t1\t588 1275\t1\t588 1283\t1\t588 1290\t1\t588 1293\t1\t588 1302\t2\t588 1355\t1\t588 1355\t1\t588"}
{"id": 590, "text": "Toward a Theory of Indexing--II Landry, Bertrand C. Rush, James E. The purpose of this paper is to present the elements of a basis for a theory of information storage and retrieval.. It is believed that this theory can best be formulated in terms of a general theory of indexing.. After stating basic premises and defining essential concepts, the relationship between a theory of indexing and a theory of information storage and retrieval is considered.. The similarities between the indexing process and the general communication process are discussed, and indexing is viewed as an order increasing (i.e., entropy decreasing) operation.. The concept of a theoretical index is developed and contrasted with real-world indexing systems.. The relationship between query formulation, retrieval, and benefit is discussed, and these notions are then related to the human performance variable.  It is believed that the ideas presented in this paper provide a useful framework for more detailed investigations into the indexing process.. 29\t1\t590 58\t2\t590 68\t1\t590 117\t3\t590 165\t2\t590 168\t1\t590 320\t1\t590 445\t2\t590 451\t1\t590 476\t1\t590 525\t1\t590 572\t2\t590 590\t5\t590 609\t1\t590 621\t1\t590 656\t1\t590 664\t1\t590 668\t1\t590 670\t1\t590 671\t1\t590 674\t1\t590 683\t2\t590 689\t3\t590 715\t1\t590 762\t1\t590 797\t1\t590 814\t1\t590 819\t1\t590 901\t1\t590 1045\t1\t590 1046\t2\t590 1047\t1\t590 1077\t2\t590 1213\t1\t590 1231\t2\t590 1389\t1\t590 1443\t2\t590 1443\t2\t590"}

{"id": 595, "text": "Selected Results From An Inquiry Into Testing of Information Retrieval Systems Saracevic, Tefko A variety of aspects related to testing of retrieval systems were examined.. A model of a retrieval system, together with a set of measures and a methodology for performance testing were developed.. In the main experiment the effect on performance of the following variables was tested:  sources of indexing, indexing languages, coding schemes, question analyses, search strategies and formats of output.. In addition, a series of separate experiments was carried out to investigate the problems of controls in experimentation with IR systems.. The main conclusions:  the human factor appears to be the main variable in all components of an IR system; length of indexes affects performance considerably more than indexing languages; question analyses and search strategies to affect performance to a great extent - as much, if not  more than indexing.. Retrieval systems seem to be able to perform at present only on a general level, failing to be at the same time comprehensive and specific.. It seems that testing of total IR systems controlling and monitoring all factors (environmental and systems-related) is not possible at present.. 18\t1\t595 28\t1\t595 34\t1\t595 35\t1\t595 42\t1\t595 43\t1\t595 49\t1\t595 52\t1\t595 53\t1\t595 57\t1\t595 59\t1\t595 68\t1\t595 70\t1\t595 73\t1\t595 75\t1\t595 77\t1\t595 78\t1\t595 79\t1\t595 81\t1\t595 95\t1\t595 157\t1\t595 161\t1\t595 164\t1\t595 175\t2\t595 176\t1\t595 197\t1\t595 202\t1\t595 213\t1\t595 224\t2\t595 243\t1\t595 298\t1\t595 329\t1\t595 375\t1\t595 381\t2\t595 389\t1\t595 420\t2\t595 421\t1\t595 445\t1\t595 454\t1\t595 456\t1\t595 458\t1\t595 465\t1\t595 466\t1\t595 468\t1\t595 472\t1\t595 490\t1\t595 491\t1\t595 503\t1\t595 506\t2\t595 507\t2\t595 510\t1\t595 512\t1\t595 514\t2\t595 518\t1\t595 554\t2\t595 565\t3\t595 572\t1\t595 575\t1\t595 578\t1\t595 579\t2\t595 582\t1\t595 585\t1\t595 589\t1\t595 591\t3\t595 592\t1\t595 593\t2\t595 594\t2\t595 595\t10\t595 596\t2\t595 597\t1\t595 599\t2\t595 600\t1\t595 603\t3\t595 604\t2\t595 606\t1\t595 608\t1\t595 615\t2\t595 619\t2\t595 620\t1\t595 621\t1\t595 622\t1\t595 623\t1\t595 625\t1\t595 629\t1\t595 630\t1\t595 633\t1\t595 639\t1\t595 646\t1\t595 655\t1\t595 656\t1\t595 657\t1\t595 659\t1\t595 676\t1\t595 711\t1\t595 722\t1\t595 723\t2\t595 724\t1\t595 726\t1\t595 728\t1\t595 730\t1\t595 731\t1\t595 732\t1\t595 752\t2\t595 762\t1\t595 780\t1\t595 785\t1\t595 790\t1\t595 801\t1\t595 805\t1\t595 806\t1\t595 809\t1\t595 810\t2\t595 812\t1\t595 813\t2\t595 814\t2\t595 820\t2\t595 822\t3\t595 827\t1\t595 828\t1\t595 829\t1\t595 836\t1\t595 866\t1\t595 867\t1\t595 870\t2\t595 879\t1\t595 894\t1\t595 895\t1\t595 907\t1\t595 928\t1\t595 956\t2\t595 963\t1\t595 989\t1\t595 990\t1\t595 991\t1\t595 1054\t1\t595 1091\t2\t595 1118\t1\t595 1124\t1\t595 1131\t1\t595 1154\t1\t595 1232\t1\t595 1255\t1\t595 1281\t2\t595 1282\t1\t595 1283\t1\t595 1295\t1\t595 1298\t3\t595 1299\t2\t595 1309\t1\t595 1327\t2\t595 1363\t1\t595 1366\t1\t595 1367\t1\t595 1368\t1\t595 1382\t1\t595 1396\t1\t595 1405\t1\t595 1413\t1\t595 1445\t1\t595 1445\t1\t595"}

Through the use of cost analysis, the model provides a method for comparative evaluation between information retrieval systems.. The cost model divides the costs of a retrieval system into two components:  system costs and user costs.. In addition, it suggests that a trade off exists between the performance level of the system and the combination of user and systems time that is expended in working with the system.. This minimizes the total cost of operating the system.. The allocation is done for a given performance level and for a given cost per unit of user and system time.."}

{"id": 655, "text": "The Potential Usefulness of Catalog Access Points Other Than Author, Title, and  Subject Cooper, William S. Library patrons who wish to obtain a known document with which they have had prior personal contact often cannot remember the standard author- title-subject information about it with sufficient accuracy to be able to look it up easily in present-day card catalogs.. However, they may remember a surprising amount of such \"nonstandard\" information as the color of the document's cover or its approximate length.. Could this type of \"nonstandard\" information be profitably exploited in computerized catalogs of the future?  Such facilities, if available, would surely be used, for according to catalog usage surveys a majority of today's library patrons seek known documents, and of these, a substantial minority possess nonstandard information.. In this report, the results of a memory experiment to test the memorability of various types of nonstandard information are described and analyzed.. A ranking according to relative memorability and potential retrieval usefulness of various nonstandard book features is given.. It is estimated that if the average patron's nonstandard information were exploited by appropriate retrieval strategies, he would only have to search through roughly one five-hundredth as many documents as in a random search..

{"id": 656, "text": "Measures of the Usefulness of Written Technical Information to Chemical Researchers Kegan,  Daniel L. The effective transfer of technology involves more than just distributing paper; it demands that useful documents be disseminated with a minimum of useless ones.. For 1 month, 10 researchers recorded a sample of the written technical information items that they received; 4 months later they were interviewed to determine which of these items had proved useful, and in what ways.. The results indicate that (1) a researcher will call an item \"useful\" even if it does not cause him to take some action, but only has some significance for him; (2) the more the source of an item knows about the needs of the researcher or the more the researcher knows about an item he seeks, the more likely it is that the researcher will find the item useful; (3) no strong relationships were found between certain readily observable, physical arrangements and information behavior; and (4) an item may prove useful, not because of the information objectively contained in that item, but because the item causes a cognitive restructuring of the researcher's mind or a \"free association.\" Other studies that restrict their measures of information usefulness to externally observable behavior or that do not carefully define usefulness may not be validly representing usefulness to the researcher.. 29\t1\t656 35\t1\t656 42\t1\t656 43\t1\t656 52\t1\t656 58\t1\t656 70\t1\t656 73\t1\t656 81\t1\t656 89\t1\t656 95\t1\t656 105\t1\t656 109\t1\t656 110\t1\t656 155\t1\t656 157\t2\t656 165\t1\t656 314\t1\t656 356\t1\t656 420\t1\t656 426\t1\t656 445\t1\t656 451\t1\t656 475\t1\t656 544\t1\t656 560\t1\t656 578\t1\t656 582\t2\t656 589\t1\t656 590\t1\t656 594\t1\t656 595\t1\t656 609\t1\t656 655\t1\t656 656\t5\t656 657\t1\t656 658\t1\t656 685\t1\t656 689\t1\t656 762\t1\t656 814\t1\t656 901\t1\t656 1030\t1\t656 1050\t1\t656 1054\t1\t656 1062\t1\t656 1077\t1\t656 1154\t1\t656 1231\t1\t656 1232\t1\t656 1256\t1\t656 1281\t1\t656 1284\t1\t656 1285\t1\t656 1290\t1\t656 1291\t1\t656 1293\t1\t656 1294\t1\t656 1295\t2\t656 1296\t1\t656 1297\t1\t656 1298\t1\t656 1319\t1\t656 1321\t1\t656 1346\t1\t656 1361\t1\t656 1386\t1\t656 1386\t1\t656"}
{"id": 666, "text": "New Methods in Automatic Extracting Edmundson, H.P. This paper describes new methods of automatically extracting documents for screening purposes, i.e. the computer selection of sentences having the greatest possible potential for conveying to the reader the substance of the document.  While previous work has focused on one component of sentence significance, namely, the presence of high-frequency content words (key words), the methods described here also treat three additional components: pragmatic words (cue words); title and heading words; and structural indicators (sentence location). The research has resulted in an operating system and a research methodology. The extracting system is parameterized to control and vary the influence of the above four components.

{"id": 706, "text": "A Graph-Theoretic Algorithm for Matching Chemical Structures Sussenguth, E.H., Jr. There are many chemical retrieval systems which process the first type of request efficiently.  Most of these systems are also capable of handling certain fragment requests; however, the fragments which can be processed are frequently of a restricted nature.  For example, in retrieval systems which are based on linear ciphers, only those fragments which are explicit in the cipher are readily detected.  To allow a completely general specification of fragments it seems inevitable that a detailed atom-by-atom comparison is required of the query and library structures.  A technique for making such detailed comparisons is presented in this report.  This technique is novel in that it avoids the excessive backtracking ad restarting required by other atom-by-atom matching procedures. Before giving the details of the proposed algorithm, some definitions are reviewed and a brief example is presented to illustrate the over-all concepts.  Then the flow diagram of the algorithm is explained in terms of additional examples.  Finally, the mechanization of the algorithm for a digital computer is discussed. This report is a condensed version of the original, which gives a generalization and comprehensive description of the algorithm, proofs of convergence and related topics, and applications other than chemical retrieval systems. 116\t1\t706 117\t1\t706 253\t1\t706 254\t1\t706 327\t3\t706 568\t2\t706 569\t1\t706 641\t1\t706 668\t1\t706 669\t1\t706 670\t1\t706 671\t2\t706 673\t1\t706 677\t2\t706 678\t2\t706 679\t1\t706 682\t1\t706 689\t1\t706 690\t1\t706 693\t1\t706 694\t1\t706 695\t1\t706 698\t1\t706 700\t1\t706 704\t1\t706 706\t10\t706 707\t1\t706 730\t1\t706 738\t1\t706 833\t1\t706 890\t3\t706 1026\t2\t706 1072\t1\t706 1092\t1\t706 1202\t1\t706 1292\t2\t706 1301\t1\t706 1444\t1\t706 1452\t2\t706 1452\t2\t706"}

In a 1973 paper, Sengupta analysed references to biochemical journals in an attempt to provide a guide for librarians with a limited budget.  He not only ranked journals by the absolute number of citations made to 1969 volumes, but related the number of citations to the number of papers and even to the number of words in each journal, as perhaps 'a better guide to selection of journals for subscription than position in the ranking list.'

These authors collected a large number of references to a certain subject, and arranged the periodicals in which the references occurred in order of decreasing productivity.  Thus for applied geophysics they found (loc. cit., p. 112) 1 periodical containing 93 references, 1 containing 86, 4 containing 16, 49 containing 2, and 169 containing only 1 reference.  They then made cumulative totals for the two sets of figures, so that in the T most productive periodicals there occurred in all R references.  Bradford then plotted log T against R and his curves are reproduced as B and C in Fig. 1.  An exactly similar procedure for periodical references borrowed by Butterwick resulted in curve A.

A collaborative empirical investigation is proposed.. 33\t5\t800 36\t3\t800 41\t1\t800 57\t1\t800 89\t1\t800 90\t1\t800 97\t1\t800 101\t1\t800 102\t1\t800 105\t1\t800 106\t2\t800 111\t1\t800 112\t1\t800 155\t1\t800 161\t1\t800 163\t1\t800 183\t2\t800 184\t3\t800 193\t3\t800 195\t1\t800 199\t2\t800 201\t2\t800 202\t1\t800 203\t3\t800 204\t2\t800 205\t2\t800 209\t1\t800 210\t1\t800 212\t1\t800 217\t1\t800 220\t1\t800 222\t1\t800 225\t1\t800 233\t1\t800 267\t2\t800 269\t1\t800 284\t1\t800 286\t1\t800 294\t1\t800 314\t2\t800 359\t2\t800 373\t1\t800 395\t1\t800 543\t1\t800 544\t1\t800 545\t1\t800 552\t1\t800 560\t1\t800 587\t7\t800 588\t1\t800 605\t2\t800 613\t2\t800 614\t2\t800 624\t1\t800 638\t2\t800 651\t1\t800 667\t2\t800 735\t1\t800 747\t1\t800 748\t3\t800 750\t5\t800 751\t2\t800 753\t1\t800 759\t1\t800 765\t2\t800 766\t1\t800 767\t4\t800 775\t4\t800 778\t3\t800 782\t1\t800 784\t1\t800 786\t1\t800 787\t2\t800 788\t1\t800 789\t1\t800 791\t3\t800 792\t2\t800 793\t9\t800 794\t5\t800 799\t1\t800 800\t13\t800 808\t4\t800 811\t1\t800 905\t1\t800 925\t1\t800 948\t1\t800 953\t1\t800 959\t1\t800 977\t1\t800 983\t2\t800 1016\t1\t800 1019\t1\t800 1023\t1\t800 1030\t1\t800 1055\t1\t800 1063\t1\t800 1081\t2\t800 1082\t2\t800 1083\t2\t800 1085\t2\t800 1086\t1\t800 1087\t1\t800 1088\t2\t800 1090\t1\t800 1135\t1\t800 1151\t1\t800 1201\t2\t800 1222\t1\t800 1260\t1\t800 1275\t1\t800 1276\t1\t800 1278\t2\t800 1280\t1\t800 1285\t5\t800 1286\t2\t800 1287\t3\t800 1302\t1\t800 1308\t2\t800 1312\t1\t800 1334\t1\t800 1335\t1\t800 1390\t1\t800 1397\t1\t800 1401\t1\t800 1417\t2\t800 1418\t1\t800 1428\t1\t800 1432\t1\t800 1432\t1\t800"}

Terminalogy and parameters for describing the relation between figures for the use of library literature and for its age are discussed..

{"id": 812, "text": "The exhaustivity of document descriptions and the specificity of index terms are usually regarded as independent.. It is suggested that specificity should be interpreted statistically, as a function of term use rather than of term meaning.. The effect on retrieval of variations in term specificity are examined, experiments with three test collections showing in particular that frequently-occurring terms are required for good overall performance.. It is argued that terms should be weighted according to collection frequency, so that matches on less frequent, more specific, terms are of greater value than matches on frequent terms.. Results for the test collections show that considerable improvements in performance are obtained with this very simple procedure.."}

{"id": 821, "text": "Recent Growth of the Literature of Biochemistry and Changes in Ranking of Periodicals Sengupta, I. N. The ideas and techniques of physics have been systematically applied to the study of living matter since the 1950s and 1960s.. As a result a rapid and large increase has taken place in the research activity in this field and biophysics and molecular biology have emerged as important areas of study.. The consequent enormous growth of literature  in the field has created great difficulties in tracking out the significant literature of the subject.. To cope with this unprecedented growth of literature, a ranking list of periodicals in this field has been prepared on the basis of citations in the Annual review of biochemistry for 1968, 1969, and 1970.. This list is expected to reflect the impact of literature on the progress of biochemical knowledge more accurately than the list prepared by Henkle in 1938.. The present list brings out the predominant position of biochemical research in the total scientific effort today, and the increasing bias of cognate disciplines towards biochemical methodologies.. A method of analysis of the number of citations in relation to size of the journal concerned and average length of the papers published has been developed and applied in this study.. The analysis yields three parameters which should be useful in assessing the actual scientific interest of a journal in relation to the number of paper published, compactness of the information content, and the scientific value of the paper in relation to compactness of presentation.. The results of the present study have been discussed in relation to Bradford's Law of Scattering and an extension of the Law has been suggested, namely, that during phases of rapid and vigorous growth of knowledge in a scientific disciplines, articles of interest to that discipline appear in increasing numbers in periodicals distant from that field.. It is expected that the present ranking list will enable librarians and other professional workers in the field of biochemistry to select journals from the viewpoint of their significance to the active areas or present day biochemical research.. 48\t1\t821 167\t1\t821 189\t1\t821 193\t1\t821 195\t1\t821 196\t1\t821 198\t1\t821 201\t2\t821 219\t1\t821 379\t1\t821 588\t1\t821 614\t2\t821 616\t1\t821 635\t1\t821 638\t2\t821 685\t1\t821 735\t1\t821 748\t1\t821 753\t1\t821 756\t1\t821 757\t1\t821 775\t1\t821 787\t1\t821 792\t1\t821 821\t5\t821 831\t1\t821 905\t1\t821 952\t1\t821 953\t1\t821 1083\t1\t821 1210\t1\t821 1254\t1\t821 1256\t1\t821 1260\t1\t821 1275\t3\t821 1278\t1\t821 1290\t1\t821 1302\t3\t821 1352\t1\t821 1355\t2\t821 1369\t2\t821 1373\t1\t821 1397\t1\t821 1418\t1\t821 1418\t1\t821"}

This cost analysis is conducted in the context of an investment decision, using the concept of net present value, a method not previously used in library literature.. The cost analysis reveals a positive net present value and a system life break-even requirement of seven years at a 10% cost of capital.. This demonstrates that such an automated system can be economically justifiable in a library of relatively modest size (approx. 1,100 serial and periodical titles)..

Establishment of special rules of entry for serial publications which preclude attribution of authorship defeats this objective.. The present rule 6 of the Anglo_American Cataloging Rules are the Paris Principles are criticized in this regard.. In the course of this criticism, it is shown that the presence of a generic title, the presence of the name of a corporate body within the serial publication are not valid criteria for determining authorship of a serial publication.. Furthermore, using the form of publication produces unpredictable entries for serials.. Therefore, it is proposed that special rules for entry of serials be abolished, that a serial be treated like any other work of corporate or personal authorship, including compilations and works produced under editorial direction..

Confronting this goal requires a recognition of inevitable change, and we have questioned status quo, recognizing at the same time the differing pace and character requisite for the implementation of designs in the adaptability to change.

{"id": 952, "text": "Characteristics of the Research Literature Used by Chemists and Physicists in the United States Fussler, H.H. The increasing growth and complexities of research libraries are natural consequences of the growth of knowledge and the increasing complexity of knowledge. Librarians have tried to amass more and more knowledge in the form of books for the benefit of the diverse interests of their clienteles.  Their success in this activity has been reflected in the increasing difficulties of identifying satisfactorily what they have.  The processes of cataloging, classifying, and related technical routines have become increasingly complex and expensive.  The processes are of such a nature that the cost for adding each new item to a large library is, on the average, potentially if not actually, higher than that for its predecessor.  The total proportion of the budgets of large research libraries that is spent for the processing of material, as distinguished from the costs of its purchase or its direct servicing, is now such as to give librarians pause for fear a day may come when nearly all the money available to large libraries will be spent in processing material, and little will be left to service the collection or to buy new books! 14\t1\t952 19\t1\t952 31\t1\t952 36\t1\t952 37\t2\t952 39\t1\t952 40\t1\t952 41\t1\t952 46\t1\t952 47\t1\t952 48\t1\t952 88\t1\t952 96\t1\t952 97\t1\t952 102\t1\t952 103\t1\t952 132\t1\t952 137\t1\t952 167\t1\t952 181\t1\t952 182\t1\t952 183\t1\t952 184\t1\t952 189\t1\t952 193\t1\t952 195\t1\t952 198\t2\t952 201\t1\t952 221\t1\t952 233\t1\t952 237\t1\t952 253\t1\t952 255\t1\t952 269\t1\t952 272\t1\t952 297\t1\t952 298\t1\t952 313\t1\t952 359\t2\t952 377\t1\t952 379\t1\t952 395\t2\t952 415\t2\t952 505\t1\t952 543\t1\t952 560\t1\t952 573\t1\t952 614\t2\t952 618\t1\t952 632\t1\t952 635\t2\t952 638\t2\t952 667\t1\t952 735\t1\t952 748\t3\t952 749\t1\t952 751\t1\t952 753\t1\t952 756\t1\t952 757\t1\t952 760\t1\t952 764\t1\t952 765\t1\t952 767\t3\t952 772\t1\t952 774\t1\t952 775\t1\t952 777\t1\t952 778\t2\t952 782\t1\t952 787\t1\t952 792\t1\t952 804\t1\t952 805\t1\t952 821\t1\t952 831\t1\t952 891\t1\t952 893\t1\t952 905\t2\t952 951\t1\t952 952\t10\t952 953\t4\t952 958\t1\t952 964\t1\t952 968\t1\t952 1009\t1\t952 1016\t1\t952 1018\t1\t952 1019\t1\t952 1030\t1\t952 1061\t1\t952 1071\t1\t952 1083\t1\t952 1085\t1\t952 1086\t2\t952 1087\t1\t952 1182\t1\t952 1200\t1\t952 1210\t2\t952 1235\t1\t952 1240\t1\t952 1254\t1\t952 1256\t1\t952 1260\t3\t952 1274\t1\t952 1275\t6\t952 1276\t2\t952 1277\t1\t952 1278\t2\t952 1280\t2\t952 1287\t1\t952 1301\t1\t952 1302\t6\t952 1304\t1\t952 1313\t1\t952 1338\t1\t952 1339\t1\t952 1344\t1\t952 1347\t1\t952 1359\t1\t952 1365\t1\t952 1369\t1\t952 1373\t1\t952 1380\t1\t952 1397\t1\t952 1417\t1\t952 1418\t1\t952 1428\t1\t952 1444\t1\t952 1444\t1\t952"}

This requires the use of decision rules which permit library resources to be directed to those activities which yield the highest returns.. An effort is made to utilize part of welfare economics to suggest which groups of library users will provide the greatest return to society.. An evaluation of the traditional library functions of education, information, and leisure suggests that libraries should direct their resources toward educational activities and not toward recreation when public monies are involved.. A case can be made for subsidizing the library activities of school-age children, other explicitly involved in education, disadvantages minority groups and governmental officials and staff.. Since public and school libraries produce and distribute essentially the same services, it is an uneconomic use of the communities' resources to maintain two separate institutions, one of which imposes costs on the other as children are forced to use public library facilities due to school library inadequacies.. 5\t1\t957 74\t1\t957 83\t1\t957 90\t1\t957 91\t1\t957 158\t1\t957 222\t1\t957 223\t1\t957 245\t1\t957 273\t1\t957 279\t1\t957 288\t2\t957 291\t1\t957 292\t1\t957 331\t1\t957 368\t1\t957 381\t1\t957 408\t1\t957 435\t1\t957 490\t1\t957 496\t1\t957 591\t2\t957 592\t1\t957 615\t1\t957 723\t1\t957 724\t1\t957 815\t1\t957 834\t1\t957 860\t1\t957 865\t1\t957 915\t1\t957 925\t2\t957 957\t5\t957 959\t2\t957 960\t1\t957 961\t1\t957 962\t2\t957 972\t1\t957 976\t1\t957 984\t1\t957 1005\t1\t957 1018\t1\t957 1023\t1\t957 1148\t1\t957 1149\t1\t957 1219\t1\t957 1227\t3\t957 1317\t1\t957 1333\t1\t957 1353\t2\t957 1359\t1\t957 1360\t1\t957 1365\t1\t957 1390\t1\t957 1400\t2\t957 1401\t1\t957 1410\t1\t957 1424\t1\t957 1424\t1\t957"}

Three major classes of review articles were identified: (1) the annual review which aims to provide a systematic record of the contributions made within the previous year, (2) the critical review which selectively evaluates contributions to the solution of a common research problem, and (3) data compilations which are concerned with facts and findings rather than the opinions of the authors of papers from which the data are taken.. The role and control of the review article in medicine was described.. Over the past fifteen years, the ratio of review to nonreview articles in medicine has been on the order of 1:38..

Even more, it shows how a leader can simultaneously maximize both the methods which are production-oriented and those which are people-oriented.  Thus instead of putting a manager in a dilemma of choosing one or the other alternative, it illustrates that there are ways he can gain the benefits of both.  It puts various methods of managing problems into a framework where the leader can identify, study and change his own behavior.  Thus he is in a position to understand it better, to evaluate the results it produces, and to encourage its use by others. 293\t1\t1041 298\t1\t1041 304\t1\t1041 312\t1\t1041 356\t1\t1041 401\t1\t1041 418\t1\t1041 436\t1\t1041 437\t1\t1041 1036\t1\t1041 1041\t6\t1041 1069\t1\t1041 1154\t2\t1041 1187\t1\t1041 1188\t1\t1041 1233\t1\t1041 1333\t1\t1041 1406\t1\t1041 1455\t1\t1041 1455\t1\t1041"}

{"id": 1048, "text": "Measurement of Satisfaction in Work and Retirement Smith, P.C. The focus of the book can be summed up in its subtitle: A Strategy for the Study of Attitudes.  This strategy is developed by devoting considerable attention to the nature of the concept of satisfaction, and, particularly, to the requirements for scientifically adequate measures of satisfaction.  In fact, it is the emphasis on a comprehensive set of requirements for sound measurement, rather than on just one or two elements of it, which is the quality that sets this book apart from any previous report in the area of job satisfaction. Not the least of the values of this book is its basic utility for both academicians and practitioners.  For the former, it should serve as a powerful spur and guide to further fundamental research on the nature and correlates of satisfaction.  For too many years we in this area have been plagued by inadequately conceived and poorly developed measuring devices.  This has led to a plethora of studies each using a different scale or measuring instrument.  As a consequence, this has opened the door for almost anyone to claim the solution for making sense of the jigsaw pattern of findings relating to satisfaction.  At the very least, the present volume should provide researchers with a thoroughly developed measuring instrument that will allow comparability of results across studies.  If so, this may well bring some meaningful order to the present rather chaotically structured literature on job satisfaction. 15\t1\t1048 105\t1\t1048 560\t1\t1048 1048\t5\t1048 1069\t2\t1048 1186\t1\t1048 1188\t1\t1048 1233\t2\t1048 1408\t1\t1048 1454\t1\t1048 1454\t1\t1048"}

In a ongoing study designed in part to evaluate and encourage continuing education programs in community hospitals Postgraduate Medical Institute (PMI) has determined that there is need for guidance in the area of medical-library development. Reports from PMI physician consultants who visited more than 40 community hospitals indicate that medical-library facilities are generally poor and infrequently used by physicians.  The basic weaknesses of these libraries fall into four categories: inadequate collections, inadequate personnel, inadequate space, and the absence of any practical indexing system to facilitate use of collections that do exist. Failure to deal with these problems does not reflect lack of interest but rather lack of stimulation to do so and absence of any concerted source of guidance.  In response to requests for such guidance PMI has undertaken a community hospital library development project in co-operation with the New England Regional Medical Library Service (NERMLS) at the Francis A. Countway Library of Medicine.  This report is concerned with the first phase of this project - namely, the formulation of a list consisting of a minimal number of textbooks and journals that can function as the core for a medical library. Explanatory letters and questionnaires were sent to 400 specialists representing 50 areas of medical practice, including the basic sciences.  The specialists, chosen from regions throughout the country, were requested to recommend two textbooks and two journals in their area of special interest that they considered to be the most basic and fundamentally useful for practitioners.  It was also requested that recommendations be made in order of preference. 41\t2\t1147 87\t2\t1147 172\t1\t1147 189\t1\t1147 195\t1\t1147 196\t6\t1147 198\t1\t1147 199\t1\t1147 203\t1\t1147 211\t1\t1147 214\t1\t1147 215\t2\t1147 216\t1\t1147 217\t1\t1147 218\t1\t1147 219\t1\t1147 220\t1\t1147 221\t1\t1147 359\t1\t1147 415\t5\t1147 552\t1\t1147 891\t1\t1147 905\t1\t1147 949\t1\t1147 1030\t1\t1147 1071\t5\t1147 1085\t1\t1147 1086\t1\t1147 1090\t1\t1147 1147\t14\t1147 1275\t1\t1147 1302\t2\t1147 1352\t1\t1147 1397\t1\t1147 1397\t1\t1147"}

Based on statistical decision theory, it provides formal mathematical procedures for classifying patterns once they have been represented abstractly as vectors.

{"id": 1215, "text": "PRECIS:  a manual of concept analysis and subject indexing Austin, D. In 1951, the British Bibliography introduced the relatively new technique of chain indexing to British libraries.  Twenty years later, with chain procedure established as one of the standard techniques, BNB again pioneered a new approach to subject indexing when it adopted PRECIS from its first issues of 1971. To explain why this change was felt to be necessary, we have to consider these indexing systems in the light of the new approaches to handling bibliographic data which have developed over the past decade of so.  Two forces, in particular, have affected both descriptive cataloguing and subject indexing during this period; firstly, the introduction of computers; secondly, and concomitantly, the development of bibliographic data exchange networks, of which MARC is, perhaps, the primary example. In some respects, PRECIS represents a parallel development in the field of subject indexing.  Traditionally, indexing systems have also tended to be dominated by the concept of a most significant term which, once identified by the indexer, would be offered as the user's access point to the alphabetical file.  This applied most obviously to subject heading systems.  A good deal of Cutter's \"Rules for a dictionary catalog\" is devoted to the problem of identifying this most significant term in a compound heading and presenting it as the user's access point, even when this entailed a distortion of natural language, and the production of inverted headings.  The unselected component would then be lost as an entry word, unless the indexer also created a further heading or headings, in which case none of these headings would be co-extensive with the subject of the document. 86\t1\t1215 146\t1\t1215 160\t1\t1215 168\t2\t1215 194\t1\t1215 258\t1\t1215 259\t1\t1215 434\t1\t1215 445\t1\t1215 449\t1\t1215 458\t1\t1215 478\t3\t1215 480\t4\t1215 487\t1\t1215 530\t1\t1215 746\t2\t1215 758\t1\t1215 781\t1\t1215 817\t2\t1215 819\t1\t1215 824\t1\t1215 825\t7\t1215 874\t1\t1215 880\t1\t1215 901\t1\t1215 1024\t5\t1215 1027\t1\t1215 1054\t1\t1215 1061\t1\t1215 1146\t1\t1215 1215\t19\t1215 1230\t2\t1215 1231\t1\t1215 1255\t1\t1215 1265\t1\t1215 1441\t1\t1215 1443\t1\t1215 1448\t1\t1215 1448\t1\t1215"}

This book is written primarily for college students who have no previous background in operations research and who intend careers as administrators, consultants, executives, or managers in business, nonprofit enterprises, or government.  The broad topic coverage also should make the text helpful for students who seek careers as teachers and researchers as well as for practitioners who desire an up-to-date review of operations research.  The book can be used in half-year or full-year introductory courses for juniors, seniors, or graduates in business, economics, and engineering curricula. The central goal of the book is to answer the question, \"What are the fundamental ideas of operations research?\"  The text does not presuppose any advanced training in business administration, industrial engineering, mathematics, statistics, probability theory, or economics.  Therefore, the main ideas do not rely on the reader's being expert in these areas.  The text does assume, however, that the reader is not entirely naive about such subjects. 3\t1\t1219 5\t1\t1219 62\t1\t1219 90\t1\t1219 91\t1\t1219 158\t1\t1219 172\t2\t1219 175\t1\t1219 222\t2\t1219 223\t1\t1219 267\t1\t1219 360\t2\t1219 368\t1\t1219 435\t1\t1219 471\t2\t1219 494\t1\t1219 515\t1\t1219 587\t1\t1219 615\t1\t1219 660\t1\t1219 792\t1\t1219 810\t1\t1219 815\t1\t1219 823\t1\t1219 840\t1\t1219 907\t2\t1219 915\t1\t1219 925\t2\t1219 948\t1\t1219 957\t1\t1219 960\t1\t1219 1023\t1\t1219 1082\t1\t1219 1219\t10\t1219 1227\t1\t1219 1268\t2\t1219 1324\t1\t1219 1365\t1\t1219 1386\t1\t1219 1390\t1\t1219 1402\t1\t1219 1416\t1\t1219 1417\t3\t1219 1418\t2\t1219 1426\t2\t1219 1426\t2\t1219"}

The present paper is an attempt to formulate a positive theory of motivation which will satisfy these theoretical demands and at the same time conform to the known facts, clinical and observational as well as experimental.  It derives most directly, however, from clinical experience. This theory is, I think, in the functionalist tradition of James and Dewey, and is fused with the holism of Wertheimer, Goldstein, and Gestalt Psychology, and with the dynamicism of Freud and Adler.  This fusion of synthesis may arbitrarily be called a 'general-dynamic' theory. 285\t1\t1233 296\t1\t1233 298\t1\t1233 304\t1\t1233 418\t1\t1233 843\t1\t1233 844\t1\t1233 1015\t1\t1233 1020\t1\t1233 1041\t1\t1233 1048\t2\t1233 1069\t2\t1233 1070\t1\t1233 1150\t1\t1233 1233\t9\t1233 1455\t2\t1233 1455\t2\t1233"}

{"id": 1248, "text": "Reader in Library Service and the Computer Kaplan, L. The selections are intended mainly for students in library schools, and for librarians in the field who have not yet made themselves conversant with the literature of computer-based operations.  This is not a book, to state the proposition in the negative, for those who wish to read on the theoretical aspects of computers. The selections are brought together in seven sections.  The first, the Challenge, includes material on what is expected of librarians in the age of the computer. The second section, Varieties of Response, does not by any means exhaust developments in American libraries.  It does, I believe, contain representative descriptions of some of the best work being accomplished. The third section, Theory of Management, contains an outstanding article by Richard DeGennaro of Harvard.  The particular contributions made in this article are described in the editorial comment immediately preceding this third section. News Services, the fourth section, required a considerable degree of selection among a wealth of material, and is indicative of the wide variety of services which libraries are beginning to offer in the age of the computer. The considerable range of such services is exhaustively indicated in the first selection of this section, while those that follow describe specific services now being offered, or services in the planning stage. The material in the fifth section, Catalogs and the Computer, is on a subject that has elicited considerable discussion.  The two articles selected are on two aspects of the subject, namely, filing problems, and comparative costs. The sixth section, Copyright, contains an article from the legal point of view.  The more traditional library view of copyright has been ably represented by Verner Clapp in an article cited in the section on additional readings. The seventh section, Information Retrieval Testing, is a subject which has excited the attention of but few librarians, yet its influence on subject indexing could in time prove considerable. 177\t1\t1248 235\t1\t1248 289\t1\t1248 291\t1\t1248 374\t1\t1248 408\t1\t1248 458\t1\t1248 471\t1\t1248 548\t1\t1248 594\t1\t1248 597\t1\t1248 598\t1\t1248 601\t1\t1248 836\t1\t1248 863\t1\t1248 864\t1\t1248 865\t1\t1248 866\t1\t1248 868\t1\t1248 897\t1\t1248 916\t1\t1248 936\t1\t1248 1052\t1\t1248 1248\t7\t1248 1327\t1\t1248 1327\t1\t1248"}

{"id": 1330, "text": "The events of the past few years have led to a critical examination of the function of science in society.  It used to be believed that the results of scientific investigation would lead to continuous progressive improvements in conditions of life; but first the War and then the economic crisis have shown that science can be used as easily for destructive and wasteful purpose, and voices have been raised demanding the cessation of scientific research as the only means of preserving a tolerable civilization.  Scientists themselves, faced with these criticisms, have been forced to consider, effectively for the first time, how the work they are doing is connected with the social and economic developments which are occurring around them.  This book is an attempt to analyze this connection; to investigate how far scientists, individually and collectively, are responsible for this state of affairs, and to suggest what possible steps could be taken which would lead to a fruitful and not to a destructive utilization of science."}

In the present study, Professors Lipset and Bendix cast doubt on the validity of a number of widely accepted generalizations relating to social mobility: particularly (1) that there has been substantially less mobility in Europe than in the United States, (2) that social mobility tends to decline as industrial societies mature, and (3) that opportunities for entrance into the business elite become more restricted with mature industrialization.  In a careful analysis of the existing literature, the authors marshal an imposing array of evidence in support of their major thesis that social mobility is an integral and continuing aspect of the process of industrialization. 93\t2\t1331 308\t1\t1331 438\t1\t1331 1217\t3\t1331 1331\t6\t1331 1340\t2\t1331 1340\t2\t1331"}

A general account is presented of the emergence, growth, and decline of scientific research networks and their associated problem areas.. Research networks are seen to pass through three phases.. The first, exploratory phase is distinguished by a lack of effective communication among participants and by the pursuit of imprecisely defined problems.. The second phase is one of rapid growth, associated with increasing social and intellectual integration, made possible by improved communication.. An increasingly precise scientific consensus gradually emerges from a process of negotiation, in which those participants who are members of the scientific elite exert most influence.. But as consensus is achieved the problem area becomes less scientifically fruitful; and as the network grows, career opportunities diminish.. Consequently, the third, final phase is one of decline and disbandment of the network, together with the movement of participants to new areas of scientific opportunity.. 99\t1\t1342 103\t1\t1342 104\t1\t1342 108\t2\t1342 170\t1\t1342 893\t1\t1342 1063\t1\t1342 1234\t1\t1342 1273\t1\t1342 1274\t1\t1342 1300\t1\t1342 1313\t1\t1342 1315\t1\t1342 1334\t2\t1342 1342\t6\t1342 1343\t3\t1342 1345\t1\t1342 1387\t1\t1342 1444\t1\t1342 1444\t1\t1342"}

The principal goal of the book is to bring to the attention of a larger number of social scientists, particularly sociologists, the wealth of principles, ideas, and insights that have already brought a higher degree of scientific order and understanding to many areas of biology, psychology, and some physical sciences to say nothing of the applied areas of technology to which they are essential. 308\t1\t1348 435\t1\t1348 557\t1\t1348 1036\t1\t1348 1067\t2\t1348 1069\t1\t1348 1333\t1\t1348 1340\t1\t1348 1348\t7\t1348 1389\t1\t1348 1389\t1\t1348"}

Graduate students who qualify for positions as professional librarians have to learn about this vast preserve, and it is their need of guidance that explains the origin of this book. The task of this book is to place in the reader's hands a sort of chart and compass to use in finding his way around and learning how the system works. For each subject, the treatment falls into two parts.  First a specialist, sought out for his grasp of the literature, presents a bibliographical review of basic monographic works for a collection of substantive material. This review is followed by a list of reference works.  Informative annotations are provided for all works except those adequately explained by the title.  Specialized works are included, especially when they exemplify types of sources important for reference purposes.  First priority goes to works which may be looked upon as basic for a program of service to a general clientele made up of scholars, students and the public at large. If some stress falls on bibliographies, it is because they serve as controls for opening doorways to even vaster information and to sources that are more obscure."}

{"id": 1392, "text": "Subject Analysis: Computer Implications of Rigorous Definator Harris, J.L. Subject analysis for information retrieval is an area which always seems deceptively simple to those without previous background in it, however extensive their background in specific subject disciplines may be.  The basic requirement seems easy enough: to structure the statement of a subject in such a way that it can be placed into, and retrieved from, an ordered file. While attempts have been made to use simple, non-complex terms or even single words, it always becomes evident that single words are often insufficient to express a subject, and that some subjects are in themselves complex. To express such subjects requires either that their constituent concepts -- not words -- be separated and then recombined, or that only one part of the subject be shown. The former solution requires that the indexer perform the necessary analysis and synthesis, and then separate the constituents for the searcher to reassemble.  The latter forces the seeker of information to sort through many items to find those bearing on the complex topic he wants, and ma require the indexer to decide under which part(s) of the concept an entry should be made. 16\t1\t1392 114\t2\t1392 154\t1\t1392 169\t1\t1392 194\t1\t1392 212\t1\t1392 235\t1\t1392 250\t1\t1392 289\t2\t1392 345\t1\t1392 400\t1\t1392 404\t1\t1392 458\t1\t1392 459\t1\t1392 493\t1\t1392 548\t1\t1392 627\t2\t1392 770\t1\t1392 796\t1\t1392 802\t1\t1392 863\t1\t1392 864\t1\t1392 897\t1\t1392 990\t1\t1392 1073\t1\t1392 1152\t1\t1392 1368\t1\t1392 1392\t8\t1392 1414\t1\t1392 1431\t1\t1392 1448\t2\t1392 1448\t2\t1392"}

{"id": 1407, "text": "Technology, Information, and Organization Information Transfer in Industrial R and D Rosenbloom, R. S. This is an empirical study of information transfer in the R&D operations of large industrial corporations.. Its basis is a body of survey data collected from 2000 engineers and scientists in 13 establishments of four corporations and from 1200 members of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.. The data describe instances in which respondents acquired useful technical information from sources outside their immediate circle of colleagues.. The analysis is descriptive in character, following a functional approach in which the use of various means of information transfer is considered in relation to the purposes of technical work.. While the data, in general, confirm the results of other studies of this sort, they demonstrate also that the relative use of alternative means will vary significantly with the circumstances of their use.. The report explores the association of variations in a number of specific personal, organizational, and technological factors with variations in the use of sources of information.. In a more general interpretation of these findings, those variations are related to aspects of the goals of the work to which the information was applied.. The purposes of technical work are considered along two basic dimensions, one relating to the potential for contribution to the development of some body of systematic knowledge, the other to the support of particular operational objectives.. When the focus of work is on operational goals, local and informal sources account for most instances of information transfer.. Formal and more distant sources are the most common means used when the focus is on \"professional\" goals, i.e., those concerned with contributions to knowledge.. In conclusion, the report discusses the effects which management may have, within an organization, on the process of information transfer, and the need for managers and students of the process to take into account the interplay in this process of personal values, task requisites, and the structure of formal and social groups.. Firms need to establish two-way communication about needs and  possibilities; by so doing they may enhance the effectiveness with which advances in knowledge are translated into innovations in technology meeting the needs of society.. 4\t1\t1407 9\t1\t1407 32\t1\t1407 42\t1\t1407 96\t1\t1407 137\t1\t1407 152\t1\t1407 163\t1\t1407 206\t1\t1407 207\t2\t1407 208\t1\t1407 270\t1\t1407 272\t1\t1407 356\t1\t1407 456\t1\t1407 714\t1\t1407 761\t1\t1407 768\t1\t1407 774\t1\t1407 783\t1\t1407 799\t1\t1407 811\t1\t1407 816\t1\t1407 907\t1\t1407 913\t1\t1407 925\t1\t1407 961\t1\t1407 962\t1\t1407 964\t1\t1407 968\t1\t1407 1068\t1\t1407 1203\t1\t1407 1205\t1\t1407 1317\t1\t1407 1321\t3\t1407 1394\t1\t1407 1407\t5\t1407 1445\t1\t1407 1445\t1\t1407"}

{"id": 1415, "text": "Computer-Based Selective Dissemination of Information (SDI) Service for Faculty Using Library of Congress Machine-Readable Catalog (MARC) Records Studer, William Joseph From November 1966 through June 1968 the Library of Congress conducted a pilot project involving the weekly distribution of its traditional 3x5 catalog cards in machine-readable form.. The MARC records provided a search data base for an experiment in current awareness service designed to furnish faculty with biweekly lists of bibliographic notices of new monographs in their specified fields of interest.. Of the 298 social sciences faculty members queried about their interest in participating, 209 (70 percent) responded affirmatively.. Only 40 participants could be accommodated, so they were chosen in proportion to the number of faculty members in each department or school:  anthropology-l, business-10, economics-3, education-15, government-4, history-4, and sociology-3.. An \"interest\" statement from each faculty member was translated into both Library of Congress classification numbers (e.g., E6ll) and subject heading terms, i.e., elements of discrete heading separated by a comma, dash, parenthesis, or period (e.g., U.S.--HIST.--CIVIL WAR--PRISONERS, EXCHANGE OF becomes six terms:  U/S/HIST/CIVIL WAR/PRISONERS/EXCHANGE OF).. The resulting \"interest profiles\" were recorded on punched cards for computer matching with subject headings and class numbers.. The weighted term search strategy was used in comparing profiles with MARC records.. Each profile was assigned a \"cutoff weight\" or \"hit level\" of 6.. Subject heading terms were assigned positive or negative weights so that the sum of weights on matching terms would be equal to, exceed, or be less than the hit level, thereby appropriately causing or preventing the selection of a particular record.. All class numbers were assigned a weight of 6 so that a hit would occur on any matching number.. Three computer programs were employed in producing the SDI lists.. Program Extract used MARC Master Tapes as input and extracted the card number (accession number), subject heading terms, and class number for current records; Program Retrieve compared these terms and class numbers with those in the profiles and recorded the card numbers for \"hits\"; Program Print compared these card numbers with those on complete MARC records and printed three copies of each record to be sent to the faculty.. One copy was for the faculty member's own use; one was to be evaluated and returned; and one was to be used for making recommendations to the library.. Subject headings proved to be more effective in searching the MARC file mainly because multiple subject headings may be assigned to each record, whereas there is only one class number; and a hit often occurred on a record's second or third heading.. The SDI system performed well in selecting performed well in selecting relevant records, and overall evaluations were highly favorable.. Some 73 percent of notices received by faculty members were for works judged new to the faculty.  The majority felt that the SDI service provided an automatic, regular  notification of new works.. They felt that it usually brought works to their attention quicker than other sources; it informed them of items they otherwise would have missed; it furnished a compact source listing books in all but only their fields; it required very little time; and it provided a convenient means for making library recommendations and therefore increased the amount of recommending done.. All faculty expressed a desire to have SDI service continued.. 59\t1\t1415 63\t1\t1415 64\t1\t1415 175\t2\t1415 243\t1\t1415 245\t1\t1415 355\t1\t1415 374\t1\t1415 382\t1\t1415 481\t1\t1415 482\t1\t1415 717\t2\t1415 718\t1\t1415 719\t1\t1415 781\t1\t1415 783\t1\t1415 834\t1\t1415 835\t1\t1415 848\t1\t1415 849\t1\t1415 850\t1\t1415 851\t1\t1415 852\t1\t1415 857\t1\t1415 859\t1\t1415 922\t1\t1415 925\t1\t1415 980\t1\t1415 981\t1\t1415 982\t1\t1415 1042\t2\t1415 1051\t2\t1415 1410\t1\t1415 1415\t5\t1415 1426\t1\t1415 1426\t1\t1415"}

Copyright protection became necessary with the invention of the printing press and had its early beginnings in the British censorship laws.  The fortunes of the law of copyright have always been closely connected with freedom of expression, on the one hand, and with technological improvements in means of dissemination, on the other.  Successive ages have drawn different balances among the interest of the writer in the control and exploitation of his intellectual property, the related interest of the publisher, and the competing interest of society in the untrammeled dissemination of ideas.  It is this striking of balances in the law of copyright in the past, at present, and for the future, which constitutes the central theme of the James Carpentier Lectures delivered by Professor Benjamin Kaplan at the Columbia University School of Law in March, 1966. 337\t1\t1438 1438\t5\t1438 1438\t5\t1438"}

It is tempting to say that it is a half a century overdue.  When librarians first began to look beyond their national borders, bibliographic control was in the forefront of their concern.  Gradually, however, these pioneers of international librarianship began to realize that technical problems were too ambitious for multilateral action and in their discussions the emphasis was placed more on functions and organizations, on the social and even economic achievements of the international library community - which was not fully international at all - were limited to comparisons of national efforts, with some countries constantly over-critical and others overgenerous.  Outstanding bibliographic projects, like the Gesamtkatalog der Wiegendrucke, were international in scope, but national in conception. 92\t1\t1441 94\t1\t1441 121\t1\t1441 172\t1\t1441 235\t1\t1441 246\t1\t1441 247\t1\t1441 299\t1\t1441 326\t1\t1441 333\t1\t1441 361\t1\t1441 365\t1\t1441 434\t1\t1441 453\t1\t1441 530\t1\t1441 534\t1\t1441 541\t1\t1441 639\t1\t1441 652\t1\t1441 824\t1\t1441 825\t2\t1441 856\t1\t1441 872\t1\t1441 873\t1\t1441 874\t1\t1441 878\t1\t1441 880\t1\t1441 881\t1\t1441 886\t1\t1441 888\t1\t1441 913\t1\t1441 919\t1\t1441 920\t1\t1441 921\t1\t1441 939\t1\t1441 940\t1\t1441 941\t1\t1441 943\t1\t1441 947\t1\t1441 950\t1\t1441 963\t1\t1441 991\t1\t1441 996\t1\t1441 997\t1\t1441 1000\t1\t1441 1004\t1\t1441 1061\t1\t1441 1080\t1\t1441 1146\t1\t1441 1153\t1\t1441 1215\t1\t1441 1216\t1\t1441 1257\t1\t1441 1258\t1\t1441 1266\t1\t1441 1374\t1\t1441 1395\t1\t1441 1433\t1\t1441 1435\t1\t1441 1436\t1\t1441 1437\t1\t1441 1441\t15\t1441 1441\t15\t1441"}
{"id": 1445, "text": "User Requirements in Identifying Desired Works in Large Libraries Lipetz, B.A. The work reported here is a study of the utilization of the card catalog of a very large library, specifically the principal catalog of the library system of Yale University. The study was motivated by two basic concerns, one of them of a long-term, or exploratory, nature, the other of a short-term, or operationally supportive, nature.  The long-term concern is the question of how to design a computerized catalog for a very large library that can be expected to give the best possible performance.  The short-term concern is the question of whether, and, of so, how, existing card catalogs in very large libraries may be made more responsive to user requirements.  It was recognized that a carefully designed study of actual utilization of a catalog of a large library could shed useful light in both areas of concern. 4\t1\t1445 9\t1\t1445 32\t1\t1445 57\t1\t1445 75\t1\t1445 96\t1\t1445 128\t1\t1445 132\t1\t1445 137\t1\t1445 163\t1\t1445 176\t1\t1445 207\t1\t1445 246\t1\t1445 265\t1\t1445 274\t1\t1445 276\t1\t1445 287\t1\t1445 329\t1\t1445 331\t1\t1445 348\t1\t1445 408\t1\t1445 456\t1\t1445 502\t1\t1445 554\t1\t1445 560\t1\t1445 565\t1\t1445 572\t1\t1445 584\t1\t1445 595\t1\t1445 596\t1\t1445 608\t1\t1445 619\t1\t1445 646\t1\t1445 647\t1\t1445 652\t1\t1445 654\t1\t1445 655\t1\t1445 768\t1\t1445 774\t1\t1445 783\t3\t1445 799\t2\t1445 810\t1\t1445 811\t1\t1445 812\t1\t1445 813\t1\t1445 814\t1\t1445 816\t1\t1445 823\t1\t1445 827\t1\t1445 851\t1\t1445 856\t1\t1445 857\t1\t1445 858\t1\t1445 859\t1\t1445 860\t1\t1445 861\t1\t1445 862\t1\t1445 870\t1\t1445 888\t1\t1445 894\t1\t1445 913\t1\t1445 919\t2\t1445 920\t1\t1445 922\t1\t1445 928\t1\t1445 961\t1\t1445 962\t1\t1445 963\t1\t1445 964\t1\t1445 968\t1\t1445 970\t1\t1445 990\t1\t1445 991\t1\t1445 1003\t1\t1445 1012\t1\t1445 1013\t1\t1445 1035\t1\t1445 1068\t1\t1445 1203\t1\t1445 1255\t1\t1445 1291\t1\t1445 1315\t1\t1445 1321\t1\t1445 1340\t1\t1445 1395\t1\t1445 1407\t1\t1445 1413\t1\t1445 1445\t10\t1445 1445\t10\t1445"}

As world-wide stresses have increased, many individuals and organizations have begun to study and to influence the changing aspects of the world situation.  But it seems fair to observe that most of the activity has been addressed to separate facets of the world system.  Little has yet been done to show how the many actions and forces are affecting one another to produce the total consequences that we observe.  Now however, many persons are coming to believe that the interactions within the whole are more important than the sum of the separate parts.  This book was undertaken as one step toward showing how the behavior of the world system results from mutual interplay between its demographic, industrial, and agricultural subsystems. 350\t1\t1456 435\t1\t1456 1025\t1\t1456 1402\t1\t1456 1456\t6\t1456 1456\t6\t1456"}
